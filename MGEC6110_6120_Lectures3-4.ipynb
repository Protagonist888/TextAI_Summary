      "edition was well-liked by students. \"So why is our publisher pushing \n",
      "or a new edition?\" the authors wondered. \"Were some of the examples \n",
      "becoming stale? Or might it have something to do with the used book market?\" \n",
      "Could be both. In any case, here they are again, with a new edition that has sub­\n",

      "For students who care about how the world works, microeconomics is prob­\n",
      "ably the most relevant, interesting, and important subject they can study. \n",
      "(Macroeconomics is the second-most important subject.) A good grasp \n",
      "of microeconomics is vital for managerial decision making, for designing and \n",
      "understanding public policy, and, more generally, for appreciating how a mod­\n",
      "ern economy functions. In fact, even understanding the news each day often \n",
      "requires knowledge of microeconomics. \n",
      "We wrote this book, Microeconomics, because we believe that students need to \n",
      "be exposed to the new topics that have come to play a central role in microeco­\n",
      "nomics over the years-topics such as game theory and competitive strategy, the \n",
      "roles of uncertainty and information, and the analysis of pricing by firms with \n",
      "market power. We also felt that students need to be shown how microeconomics \n",
      "can help us to understand what goes on in the world and how it can be used as \n",
      "a practical tool for decision making. Microeconomics is an exciting and dynamic \n",
      "subject, but students need to be given an appreciation of its relevance and use­\n",
      "fulness. They want and need a good understanding of how microeconomics can \n",
      "actually be used outside the classroom. \n",
      "To respond to these needs, the ninth edition of Microeconomics provides a \n",
      "treatment of microeconomic theory that stresses its relevance and application \n",
      "to both managerial and public policy decision making. This applied emphasis \n",
      "is accomplished by including examples that cover such topics as the analysis of \n",
      "demand, cost, and market efficiency; the design of pricing strategies; investment \n",
      "and production decisions; and public policy analysis. Because of the importance \n",
      "that we attach to these examples, they are included in the flow of the text. (A \n",
      "complete list is included on the endpapers inside the front cover.) \n",
      "The coverage in this edition of Microeconomics incorporates the dramatic chang­\n",
      "es that have occurred in the field in recent years. There has been growing interest \n",
      "in game theory and the strategic interactions of firms (Chapters 12 and 13), in \n",
      "the role and implications of uncertainty and asymmetric information (Chapters 5 \n",
      "and 17), in the pricing strategies of firms with market power (Chapters 10 and 11), \n",
      "in the design of policies to deal efficiently with externalities such as environmental \n",
      "pollution (Chapter 18), and in behavioral economics (Chapter 19). \n",
      "That the coverage in Microeconomics is comprehensive and up to date does \n",
      "not mean that it is \"advanced\" or difficult. We have worked hard to make the \n",
      "exposition clear and accessible as well as lively and engaging. We believe that \n",
      "the study of microeconomics should be enjoyable and stimulating. We hope that \n",
      "our book reflects this belief. Except for appendices and footnotes, Microeconom­\n",
      "ics uses no calculus. As a result, it should be suitable for students with a broad \n",
      "range of backgrounds. (Those sections that are more demanding are marked \n",
      "with an asterisk and can be easily omitted.) xv \n",
      "xvi PREFACE \n",
      "Changes in the Ninth Edition \n",
      "Each new edition of this book is built on the success of prior editions by \n",
      "adding some new topics, by adding and updating examples, and by im­\n",
      "proving the exposition of existing materials. We continue that tradition in \n",
      "this ninth edition. We have made a number of changes throughout the book, but \n",
      "the most important are the following: \n",
      "• We added a new chapter (Chapter 19) on behavioral economics. Behav­\n",
      "ioral economics goes beyond the simple paradigm of maximizing some­\n",
      "thing (e.g., utility, output, profit) subject to a constraint (e.g., income, cost, \n",
      "demand and cost). While this paradigm has been extremely powerful in \n",
      "helping us understand how markets work, it does not accurately describe \n",
      "how real-world consumers and firms behave. The new and flourishing field \n",
      "of behavioral economics incorporates findings from psychology into our \n",
      "descriptions of how consumers and firms make decisions. Although the \n",
      "previous edition of this book had a section on behavioral economics (that \n",
      "appeared in Chapter 5), we decided that this topic was sufficiently impor­\n",
      "tant to deserve a chapter of its own. \n",
      "We have updated many of the examples (as we do in every new edition), but \n",
      "we also added several new ones. \n",
      "• We now have several examples of taxicab markets that include the entry of \n",
      "\"ride-share\" services like Uber and Lyft (Chapters 9 and 13). \n",
      "• We added an example about Tesla's new battery factory (its \"Gigafactory\") \n",
      "and how scale economies will reduce the cost of batteries for electric cars \n",
      "(Chapter 7). \n",
      "• We added an example on merger policy (Chapter 10) and one on the Auto \n",
      "Parts Cartel (Chapter 12). \n",
      "• We even have two examples (in Chapters 1 and 12) that deal with the pricing \n",
      "of this textbook. \n",
      "• As part of the new Chapter 19, we added several examples that are \"behav­\n",
      "ioral\" in nature, including consumers' use of credit card debt (and apparent \n",
      "willingness to pay extremely high interest rates) and decisions to join and \n",
      "use health clubs. \n",
      "• With the exception of the new Chapter 19, the layout of this edition is simi­\n",
      "lar to that of the prior edition. This has allowed us to continue to define key \n",
      "terms in the margins (as well as in the Glossary at the end of the book) and to \n",
      "use the margins to include Concept Links that relate newly developed ideas \n",
      "to concepts introduced previously in the text. \n",
      "Alternative Course Designs \n",
      "This new edition of Microeconomics offers instructors considerable flexibil­\n",
      "ity in course design. For a one-quarter or one-semester course stressing \n",
      "the basic core material, we would suggest using the following chapters \n",
      "and sections of chapters: 1 through 6, 7.1-7.4, 8 through 10, 11.1-11.3, 12, 14, \n",
      "15.1-15.4, 18.1-18.2, and 18.5. A somewhat more ambitious course might also in­\n",
      "clude parts of Chapters 5, 16, and 19 and additional sections in Chapters 7 and 9. \n",
      "To emphasize uncertainty and market failure, an instructor should also include \n",
      "substantial parts of Chapters 5 and 17. \n",
      "Depending on one's interests and the goals of the course, other sections could \n",
      "be added or used to replace the materials listed above. A course emphasizing \n",
      "modern pricing theory and business strategy would include all of Chapters 11, \n",
      "12, and 13 and the remaining sections of Chapter 15. A course in managerial \n",
      "economics might also include the appendices to Chapters 4, 7, and 11, as well as \n",
      "the appendix on regression analysis at the end of the book. A course stressing \n",
      "welfare economics and public policy should include Chapter 16 and additional \n",
      "sections of Chapters 18 and 19. \n",
      "Finally, we want to stress that those sections or subsections that are more \n",
      "demanding and/ or peripheral to the core material have been marked with an \n",
      "asterisk. These sections can easily be omitted without detracting from the flow \n",
      "of the book. \n",
      "Supplementary Materials \n",
      "Ancillaries of an exceptionally high quality are available to instructors and \n",

      "and Prices \n",
      "Part 1 surveys the scope of microeconomics and intro­\n",
      "duces some basic concepts and tools. \n",
      "Chapter 1 discusses the range of problems that microeconomics \n",
      "addresses, and the kinds of answers it can provide. It also explains \n",
      "what a market is, how we determine the boundaries of a market, \n",
      "and how we measure market price. \n",
      "Chapter 2 covers one of the most important tools of microeco­\n",
      "nomics: supply-demand analysis. We explain how a competitive \n",
      "market works and how supply and demand determine the prices \n",
      "and quantities of goods and services. We also show how supply­\n",
      "demand analysis can be used to determine the effects of changing \n",
      "market conditions, including government intervention. CHAPTERS \n",

      "CHAPTER 1 \n",
      "Preliminaries \n",
      "E conomics is divided into two main branches: microeconomics \n",
      "and macroeconomics. Microeconomics deals with the behavior \n",
      "of individual economic units. These units include consumers, \n",
      "workers, investors, owners of land, business firms-in fact, any indi­\n",
      "vidual or entity that plays a role in the functioning of our economy.1 \n",
      "Microeconomics explains how and why these units make economic \n",
      "decisions. For example, it explains how consumers make purchasing \n",
      "decisions and how their choices are affected by changing prices and \n",
      "incomes. It also explains how firms decide how many workers to hire \n",
      "and how workers decide where to work and how much work to do. \n",
      "Another important concern of microeconomics is how eco­\n",
      "nomic units interact to form larger units-markets and industries. \n",
      "Microeconomics helps us to understand, for example, why the \n",
      "American automobile industry developed the way it did and how \n",
      "producers and consumers interact in the market for automobiles. It ex­\n",
      "plains how automobile prices are determined, how much automobile \n",
      "companies invest in new factories, and how many cars are produced \n",
      "each year. By studying the behavior and interaction of individual firms \n",
      "and consumers, microeconomics reveals how industries and markets \n",
      "operate and evolve, why they differ from one another, and how they \n",
      "are affected by government policies and global economic conditions. \n",
      "By contrast, macroeconomics deals with aggregate economic \n",
      "quantities, such as the level and growth rate of national output, inter­\n",
      "est rates, unemployment, and inflation. But the boundary between \n",
      "macroeconomics and microeconomics has become less and less \n",
      "distinct in recent years. The reason is that macroeconomics also in­\n",
      "volves the analysis of markets-for example, the aggregate markets \n",
      "for goods and services, labor, and corporate bonds. To understand \n",
      "how these aggregate markets operate, we must first understand \n",
      "the behavior of the firms, consumers, workers, and investors who \n",
      "constitute them. Thus macroeconomists have become increasingly \n",
      "concerned with the microeconomic foundations of aggregate eco­\n",
      "nomic phenomena, and much of macroeconomics is actually an ex­\n",
      "tension of microeconomic analysis. \n",
      "1The prefix micro-is derived from the Greek word meaning \"small.\" However, many of \n",
      "the individual economic units that we will study are small only in relation to the U.S. \n",
      "economy as a whole. For example, the annual sales of General Motors, IBM, or Microsoft \n",
      "are larger than the gross national products of many countries . CHAPTER OUTLINE \n",

      "of economics that deals with \n",

      "such as the level and growth rate \n",
      "of national output, interest rates, \n",
      "unemployment , and inflation. 1.1 The Themes of Microeconomics \n",
      "The Rolling Stones once said: \"You can't always get what you want.\" This is \n",
      "true. For most people (even Mick Jagger), that there are limits to what you can \n",
      "have or do is a simple fact of life learned in early childhood. For economists, \n",
      "however, it can be an obsession. \n",
      "Much of microeconomics is about limits-the limited incomes that consum­\n",
      "ers can spend on goods and services, the limited budgets and technical know­\n",
      "how that firms can use to produce things, and the limited number of hours in \n",
      "a week that workers can allocate to labor or leisure. But microeconomics is also \n",
      "about ways to make the most of these limits. More precisely, it is about the alloca­\n",
      "tion of scarce resources. For example, microeconomics explains how consumers \n",
      "can best allocate their limited incomes to the various goods and services avail­\n",
      "able for purchase. It explains how workers can best allocate their time to labor \n",
      "instead of leisure, or to one job instead of another. And it explains how firms \n",
      "can best allocate limited financial resources to hiring additional workers versus \n",
      "buying new machinery, and to producing one set of products versus another. \n",
      "In a planned economy such as that of Cuba, North Korea, or the former \n",
      "Soviet Union, these allocation decisions are made mostly by the government. \n",
      "Firms are told what and how much to produce, and how to produce it; workers \n",
      "have little flexibility in choice of jobs, hours worked, or even where they live; \n",
      "and consumers typically have a very limited set of goods to choose from. As \n",
      "a result, many of the tools and concepts of microeconomics are of limited rel­\n",
      "evance in those countries. \n",
      "Trade-Offs \n",
      "In modem market economies, consumers, workers, and firms have much \n",
      "more flexibility and choice when it comes to allocating scarce resources. \n",
      "Microeconomics describes the trade-offs that consumers, workers, and firms \n",
      "face, and shows how these trade-offs are best made. \n",
      "The idea of making optimal trade-offs is an important theme in micro­\n",
      "economics-one that you will encounter throughout this book. Let's look at it in \n",
      "more detail. \n",
      "CONSUMERS Consumers have limited incomes, which can be spent on a wide \n",
      "variety of goods and services, or saved for the future. Consumer theory, the sub­\n",
      "ject matter of Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of this book, describes how consumers, based \n",
      "on their preferences, maximize their well-being by trading off the purchase of \n",
      "more of some goods for the purchase of less of others. We will also see how con­\n",
      "sumers decide how much of their incomes to save, thereby trading off current \n",
      "consumption for future consumption. \n",
      "WORKERS Workers also face constraints and make trade-offs. First, people \n",
      "must decide whether and when to enter the workforce. Because the kinds of \n",
      "jobs-and corresponding pay scales-available to a worker depend in part on \n",
      "educational attainment and accumulated skills, one must trade off working \n",
      "now (and earning an immediate income) for continued education (and the hope \n",
      "of earning a higher future income). Second, workers face trade-offs in their \n",
      "choice of employment. For example, while some people choose to work for \n",
      "large corporations that offer job security but limited potential for advancement, \n",
      "others prefer to work for small companies where there is more opportunity for \n",
      "CHAPTER 1 PRELIMINARIES 5 \n",
      "advancement but less security. Finally, workers must sometimes decide how \n",
      "many hours per week they wish to work, thereby trading off labor for leisure. \n",
      "FIRMS Firms also face limits in terms of the kinds of products that they can \n",
      "produce, and the resources available to produce them. General Motors, for ex­\n",
      "ample, is very good at producing cars and trucks, but it does not have the abil­\n",
      "ity to produce airplanes, computers, or pharmaceuticals. It is also constrained in \n",
      "terms of financial resources and the current production capacity of its factories. \n",
      "Given these constraints, GM must decide how many of each type of vehicle to \n",
      "produce. If it wants to produce a larger total number of cars and trucks next \n",
      "year or the year after, it must decide whether to hire more workers, build new \n",
      "factories, or do both. The theory of the firm, the subject matter of Chapters 6 \n",
      "and 7, describes how these trade-offs can best be made. \n",
      "Prices and Markets \n",
      "A second important theme of microeconomics is the role of prices. All of the \n",
      "trade-offs described above are based on the prices faced by consumers, work­\n",
      "ers, or firms. For example, a consumer trades off beef for chicken based partly \n",
      "on his or her preferences for each one, but also on their prices. Likewise, work­\n",
      "ers trade off labor for leisure based in part on the \"price\" that they can get for \n",
      "their labor-i.e., the wage. And firms decide whether to hire more workers or \n",
      "purchase more machines based in part on wage rates and machine prices. \n",
      "Microeconomics also describes how prices are determined. In a centrally \n",
      "planned economy, prices are set by the government. In a market economy, \n",
      "prices are determined by the interactions of consumers, workers, and firms. \n",
      "These interactions occur in markets-collections of buyers and sellers that to­\n",
      "gether determine the price of a good. In the automobile market, for example, \n",
      "car prices are affected by competition among Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and \n",
      "other manufacturers, and also by the demands of consumers. The central role \n",
      "of markets is the third important theme of microeconomics. We will say more \n",
      "about the nature and operation of markets shortly. \n",
      "Theories and Models \n",
      "Like any science, economics is concerned with the explamztions of observed phe­\n",
      "nomena. Why, for example, do firms tend to hire or lay off workers when the prices \n",
      "of their raw materials change? How many workers are likely to be hired or laid off \n",
      "by a firm or an industry if the price of raw materials increases by, say, 10 percent? \n",
      "In economics, as in other sciences, explanation and prediction are based on \n",
      "theories. Theories are developed to explain observed phenomena in terms of a set \n",
      "of basic rules and assumptions. The theory of the firm, for example, begins with \n",
      "a simple assumption-firms try to maximize their profits. The theory uses this \n",
      "assumption to explain how firms choose the amounts of labor, capital, and raw \n",
      "materials that they use for production and the amount of output they produce. \n",
      "It also explains how these choices depend on the prices of inputs, such as labor, \n",
      "capital, and raw materials, and the prices that firms can receive for their outputs. \n",
      "Economic theories are also the basis for making predictions. Thus the theory \n",
      "of the firm tells us whether a firm's output level will increase or decrease in \n",
      "response to an increase in wage rates or a decrease in the price of raw materi­\n",
      "als. With the application of statistical and econometric techniques, theories can \n",
      "be used to construct models from which quantitative predictions can be made. \n",
      "A model is a mathematical representation, based on economic theory, of a firm, a \n",

      "positive analysis Analysis \n",
      "describing relationships of cause \n",
      "and effect. market, or some other entity. For example, we might develop a model of a par­\n",
      "ticular firm and use it to predict by how much the firm's output level will change \n",
      "as a result of, say, a 10-percent drop in the price of raw materials. \n",
      "Statistics and econometrics also let us measure the accuracy of our predictions. \n",
      "For example, suppose we predict that a 10-percent drop in the price of raw materi­\n",
      "als will lead to a 5-percent increase in output. Are we sure that the increase in out­\n",
      "put will be exactly 5 percent, or might it be somewhere between 3 and 7 percent? \n",
      "Quantifying the accuracy of a prediction can be as important as the prediction itself. \n",
      "No theory, whether in economics, physics, or any other science, is perfectly \n",
      "correct. The usefulness and validity of a theory depend on whether it succeeds \n",
      "in explaining and predicting the set of phenomena that it is intended to explain \n",
      "and predict. Theories, therefore, are continually tested against observation. As \n",
      "a result of this testing, they are often modified or refined and occasionally even \n",
      "discarded. The process of testing and refining theories is central to the develop­\n",
      "ment of economics as a science. \n",
      "When evaluating a theory, it is important to keep in mind that it is invariably \n",
      "imperfect. This is the case in every branch of science. In physics, for example, \n",
      "Boyle's law relates the volume, temperature, and pressure of a gas.2 The law is \n",
      "based on the assumption that individual molecules of a gas behave as though \n",
      "they were tiny, elastic billiard balls. Physicists today know that gas molecules \n",
      "do not, in fact, always behave like billiard balls, which is why Boyle's law \n",
      "breaks down under extremes of pressure and temperature. Under most condi­\n",
      "tions, however, it does an excellent job of predicting how the temperature of a \n",
      "gas will change when the pressure and volume change, and it is therefore an \n",
      "essential tool for engineers and scientists. \n",
      "The situation is much the same in economics. For example, because firms do \n",
      "not maximize their profits all the time, the theory of the firm has had only limited \n",
      "success in explaining certain aspects of firms' behavior, such as the timing of \n",
      "capital investment decisions. Nonetheless, the theory does explain a broad range \n",
      "of phenomena regarding the behavior, growth, and evolution of firms and indus­\n",
      "tries, and has thus become an important tool for managers and policymakers. \n",
      "Positive versus Normative Analysis \n",
      "Microeconomics is concerned with both positive and normative questions. \n",
      "Positive questions deal with explanation and prediction, normative questions \n",
      "with what ought to be. Suppose the U.S. government imposes a quota on the \n",
      "import of foreign cars. What will happen to the price, production, and sales of \n",
      "cars? What impact will this policy change have on American consumers? On \n",
      "workers in the automobile industry? These questions belong to the realm of \n",
      "positive analysis: statements that describe relationships of cause and effect. \n",
      "Positive analysis is central to microeconomics. As we explained above, theo­\n",
      "ries are developed to explain phenomena, tested against observations, and used \n",
      "to construct models from which predictions are made. The use of economic \n",
      "theory for prediction is important both for the managers of firms and for pub­\n",
      "lic policy. Suppose the federal government is considering raising the tax on \n",
      "gasoline. The change would affect the price of gasoline, consumers' purchasing \n",
      "choices for small or large cars, the amount of driving that people do, and so on. \n",
      "2Robert Boyle (1627-1691) was a British chemist and physicist who discovered experimentally that \n",
      "pressure (P), volume (V), and temperature (1) were related in the following way: PV = RT, where \n",
      "R is a constant. Later, physicists derived this relationship as a consequence of the kinetic theory of \n",
      "gases, which describes the movement of gas molecules in statistical terms. \n",
      "CHAPTER 1 \n",
      "To plan sensibly, oil companies, automobile companies, producers of auto­\n",
      "mobile parts, and firms in the tourist industry would all need to estimate the \n",
      "impact of the change. Government policymakers would also need quantitative \n",
      "estimates of the effects. They would want to determine the costs imposed on \n",
      "consumers (perhaps broken down by income categories); the effects on profits \n",
      "and employment in the oil, automobile, and tourist industries; and the amount \n",
      "of tax revenue likely to be collected each year. \n",
      "Sometimes we want to go beyond explanation and prediction to ask such \n",
      "questions as \"What is best?\" This involves normative analysis, which is also \n",
      "important for both managers of firms and those making public policy. Again, \n",
      "consider a new tax on gasoline. Automobile companies would want to deter­\n",
      "mine the best (profit-maximizing) mix of large and small cars to produce once \n",
      "the tax is in place. Specifically, how much money should be invested to make \n",
      "cars more fuel-efficient? For policymakers, the primary issue is likely to be \n",
      "whether the tax is in the public interest. The same policy objectives (say, an in­\n",
      "crease in tax revenues and a decrease in dependence on imported oil) might be \n",
      "met more cheaply with a different kind of tax, such as a tariff on imported oil. \n",
      "Normative analysis is not only concerned with alternative policy options; it \n",
      "also involves the design of particular policy choices. For example, suppose it \n",
      "has been decided that a gasoline tax is desirable. Balancing costs and benefits, \n",
      "we then ask what is the optimal size of the tax. \n",
      "Normative analysis is often supplemented by value judgments. For example, \n",
      "a comparison between a gasoline tax and an oil import tariff might conclude \n",
      "that the gasoline tax will be easier to administer but will have a greater impact \n",
      "on lower-income consumers. At that point, society must make a value judgment, \n",
      "weighing equity against economic efficiency. When value judgments are involved, \n",
      "microeconomics cannot tell us what the best policy is. However, it can clarify the \n",
      "trade-offs and thereby help to illuminate the issues and sharpen the debate. \n",
      "1.2 What Is a Market? \n",
      "Business people, journalists, politicians, and ordinary consumers talk about \n",
      "markets all the time-for example, oil markets, housing markets, bond markets, \n",
      "labor markets, and markets for all kinds of goods and services. But often what \n",
      "they mean by the word \"market\" is vague or misleading. In economics, markets \n",
      "are a central focus of analysis, so economists try to be as clear as possible about \n",
      "what they mean when they refer to a market. \n",
      "It is easiest to understand what a market is and how it works by dividing \n",
      "individual economic units into two broad groups according to function­\n",
      "buyers and sellers. Buyers include consumers, who purchase goods and ser­\n",
      "vices, and firms, which buy labor, capital, and raw materials that they use \n",
      "to produce goods and services. Sellers include firms, which sell their goods \n",
      "and services; workers, who sell their labor services; and resource owners, \n",
      "who rent land or sell mineral resources to firms. Clearly, most people and \n",
      "most firms act as both buyers and sellers, but we will find it helpful to think \n",
      "of them as simply buyers when they are buying something and sellers when \n",
      "they are selling something. \n",
      "Together, buyers and sellers interact to form markets. A market is the collec­\n",
      "tion of buyers and sellers that, through their actual or potential interactions, determine \n",
      "the price of a product or set of products. In the market for personal computers, for \n",
      "example, the buyers are business firms, households, and students; the sellers are PRELIMINARIES 7 \n",

      "and sellers that, through their \n",

      "determine the price of a product \n",
      "or set of products. \n",

      "Determination of the buyers, \n",
      "sellers, and range of products that \n",
      "should be included in a particular \n",

      "at a low price at one location \n",
      "and selling at a higher price in \n",

      "perfectly competitive \n",
      "market Market with many \n",
      "buyers and sellers, so that no \n",
      "single buyer or seller has a \n",
      "significant impact on price. \n",
      "market price Price prevailing \n",
      "in a competitive market. Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Dell, Apple, and a number of other firms. Note that a \n",
      "market includes more than an industry. An industry is a collection of firms that sell the \n",
      "same or closely related products. In effect, an industry is the supply side of the market. \n",
      "Economists are often concerned with market definition-with determining \n",
      "which buyers and sellers should be included in a particular market. When de­\n",
      "fining a market, potential interactions of buyers and sellers can be just as impor­\n",
      "tant as actual ones. An example of this is the market for gold. A New Yorker who \n",
      "wants to buy gold is unlikely to travel to Zurich to do so. Most buyers of gold \n",
      "in New York will interact only with sellers in New York. But because the cost of \n",
      "transporting gold is small relative to its value, buyers of gold in New York could \n",
      "purchase their gold in Zurich if the prices there were significantly lower. \n",
      "Significant differences in the price of a commodity create a potential for \n",
      "arbitrage: buying at a low price in one location and selling at a higher price some­\n",
      "where else. The possibility of arbitrage prevents the prices of gold in New York \n",
      "and Zurich from differing significantly and creates a world market for gold. \n",
      "Markets are at the center of economic activity, and many of the most interest­\n",
      "ing issues in economics concern the functioning of markets. For example, why \n",
      "do only a few firms compete with one another in some markets, while in others \n",
      "a great many firms compete? Are consumers necessarily better off if there are \n",
      "many firms? If so, should the government intervene in markets with only a few \n",
      "firms? Why have prices in some markets risen or fallen rapidly, while in other \n",
      "markets prices have hardly changed at all? And which markets offer the best \n",
      "opportunities for an entrepreneur thinking of going into business? \n",
      "Competitive versus Noncompetitive Markets \n",
      "In this book, we study the behavior of both competitive and noncompetitive \n",
      "markets. A perfectly competitive market has many buyers and sellers, so that \n",
      "no single buyer or seller has any impact on price. Most agricultural markets are \n",
      "close to being perfectly competitive. For example, thousands of farmers pro­\n",
      "duce wheat, which thousands of buyers purchase to produce flour and other \n",
      "products. As a result, no single farmer and no single buyer can significantly af­\n",
      "fect the price of wheat. \n",
      "Many other markets are competitive enough to be treated as if they were \n",
      "perfectly competitive. The world market for copper, for example, contains a few \n",
      "dozen major producers. That number is enough for the impact on price to be \n",
      "small if any one producer goes out of business. The same is true for many other \n",
      "natural resource markets, such as those for coal, iron, tin, or lumber. \n",
      "Other markets containing a small number of producers may still be treated \n",
      "as competitive for purposes of analysis. For example, the U.S. airline industry \n",
      "contains several dozen firms, but most routes are served by only a few firms. \n",
      "Nonetheless, because competition among those firms is often fierce, for some \n",
      "purposes airline markets can be treated as competitive. Finally, some markets \n",
      "contain many producers but are noncompetitive; that is, individual firms can \n",
      "jointly affect the price. The world oil market is one example. Since the early \n",
      "1970s, that market has been dominated by the OPEC cartel. (A cartel is a group \n",
      "of producers that acts collectively.) \n",
      "Market Price \n",
      "Markets make possible transactions between buyers and sellers. Quantities of \n",
      "a good are sold at specific prices. In a perfectly competitive market, a single \n",
      "price-the market price-will usually prevail. The price of wheat in Kansas \n",
      "CHAPTER 1 PRELIMINARIES 9 \n",
      "City and the price of gold in New York are two examples. These prices are usu­\n",
      "ally easy to measure. For example, you can find the price of corn, wheat, or gold \n",
      "each day in the business section of a newspaper. \n",
      "In markets that are not perfectly competitive, different firms might charge \n",
      "different prices for the same product. This might happen because one firm is \n",
      "trying to win customers from its competitors, or because customers have brand \n",
      "loyalties that allow some firms to charge higher prices than others. For example, \n",
      "two brands of laundry detergent might be sold in the same supermarket at differ­\n",
      "ent prices. Or two supermarkets in the same town might sell the same brand of \n",
      "laundry detergent at different prices. In cases such as this, when we refer to the \n",
      "market price, we will mean the price averaged across brands or supermarkets. \n",
      "The market prices of most goods will fluctuate over time, and for many \n",
      "goods the fluctuations can be rapid. This is particularly true for goods sold in \n",
      "competitive markets. The stock market, for example, is highly competitive be­\n",
      "cause there are typically many buyers and sellers for any one stock. As anyone \n",
      "who has invested in the stock market knows, the price of any particular stock \n",
      "fluctuates from minute to minute and can rise or fall substantially during a \n",
      "single day. Likewise, the prices of commodities such as wheat, soybeans, coffee, \n",
      "oil, gold, silver, and lumber can rise or fall dramatically in a day or a week. \n",
      "Market Definition-The Extent of a Market \n",
      "As we saw, market definition identifies which buyers and sellers should be in­\n",
      "cluded in a given market. However, to determine which buyers and sellers to \n",
      "include, we must first determine the extent of a market-its boundaries, both \n",
      "geographically and in terms of the range of products to be included in it. \n",
      "When we refer to the market for gasoline, for example, we must be clear about \n",
      "its geographic boundaries. Are we referring to downtown Los Angeles, southern \n",
      "California, or the entire United States? We must also be clear about the range of \n",
      "products to which we are referring. Should regular-octane and high-octane pre­\n",
      "mium gasoline be included in the same market? Gasoline and diesel fuel? \n",
      "For some goods, it makes sense to talk about a market only in terms of very \n",
      "restrictive geographic boundaries. Housing is a good example. Most people \n",
      "who work in downtown Chicago will look for housing within commuting \n",
      "distance. They will not look at homes 200 or 300 miles away, even though \n",
      "those homes might be much cheaper. And homes (together with the land \n",
      "they are sitting on) 200 miles away cannot be easily moved closer to Chicago. \n",
      "Thus the housing market in Chicago is separate and distinct from, say, that in \n",
      "Cleveland, Houston, Atlanta, or Philadelphia. Likewise, retail gasoline mar­\n",
      "kets, though less limited geographically, are still regional because of the ex­\n",
      "pense of shipping gasoline over long distances. Thus the market for gasoline \n",
      "in southern California is distinct from that in northern Illinois. On the other \n",
      "hand, as we mentioned earlier, gold is bought and sold in a world market; the \n",
      "possibility of arbitrage prevents the price from differing significantly from \n",
      "one location to another. \n",
      "We must also think carefully about the range of products to include in \n",

      "Market definition is important for two reasons: \n",
      "• A company must understand who its actual and potential competitors are for \n",
      "the various products that it sells or might sell in the future. It must also know \n",
      "the product boundaries and geographical boundaries of its market in order to \n",
      "set price, determine advertising budgets, and make capital investment decisions. \n",
      "• Market definition can be important for public policy decisions. Should the \n",
      "government allow a merger or acquisition involving companies that produce \n",
      "similar products, or should it challenge it? The answer depends on the im­\n",
      "pact of that merger or acquisition on future competition and prices; often this \n",
      "can be evaluated only by defining a market. \n",
      "EXAMPLE 1.1 THE MARKET FOR SWEETENERS \n",
      "In 1990, the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) \n",
      "acquired the Clinton Corn Processing Company (CCP).4 \n",
      "ADM was a large company that produced many agri­\n",
      "cultural products, one of which was high-fructose corn \n",
      "syrup (HFCS). CCP was another major U.S. corn syrup \n",
      "producer . The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) chal­\n",
      "lenged the acquisition on the grounds that it would \n",
      "lead to a dominant producer of corn syrup with the \n",
      "power to push prices above competitive levels. Indeed, \n",
      "ADM and CCP together accounted for over 70 percent \n",
      "of U.S. corn syrup production. \n",
      "ADM fought the DOJ decision, and the case went \n",
      "to court. The basic issue was whether corn syrup \n",
      "represented a distinct market. If it did, the combined \n",
      "market share of ADM and CCP would have been about \n",
      "40 percent, and the DOJ's concern might have been \n",
      "warranted . ADM, however, argued that the correct \n",
      "market definition was much broader-a market for \n",
      "sweeteners which included sugar as well as corn syrup. \n",
      "Because the ADM-CCP combined share of a sweetener \n",
      "market would have been quite small, there would be \n",
      "no concern about the company's power to raise prices. \n",
      "ADM argued that sugar and corn syrup should be \n",
      "considered part of the same market because they are used interchangeably to sweeten a vast array of food \n",
      "products, such as soft drinks, spaghetti sauce, and \n",
      "pancake syrup. ADM also showed that as the level of \n",
      "prices for corn syrup and sugar fluctuated, industrial \n",
      "food producers would change the proportions of \n",
      "each sweetener that they used in their products. In \n",
      "October 1990, a federal judge agreed with ADM's \n",
      "argument that sugar and corn syrup were both part of \n",
      "a broad market for sweeteners . The acquisition was \n",
      "allowed to go through. \n",
      "Sugar and corn syrup continue to be used almost \n",
      "interchangeably to satisfy Americans' strong taste \n",
      "for sweetened foods. The use of all sweeteners rose \n",
      "steadily through the 1990s, reaching 150 pounds per \n",
      "person in 1999. But starting in 2000, sweetener use \n",
      "began to decline as health concerns led people to \n",
      "find substitute snacks with less added sugar. By 2014, \n",
      "American per-capita consumption of sweeteners had \n",
      "dropped to 131 pounds per person. In addition, \n",
      "people consumed more sugar (68 pounds per person) \n",
      "than corn syrup (46 pounds per person). Part of the \n",
      "shift from corn syrup to sugar was due to a growing \n",
      "belief that sugar is somehow more \"natural\"-and \n",
      "therefore healthier-than corn syrup. \n",
      "3How can we determine the extent of a market? Since the market is where the price of a good is \n",
      "established, one approach focuses on market prices. We ask whether product prices in different \n",

      "We often want to compare the price of a good today with what it was in the past \n",
      "or is likely to be in the future. To make such a comparison meaningful, we need \n",
      "to measure prices relative to an overall price level. In absolute terms, the price of \n",
      "a dozen eggs is many times higher today than it was 50 years ago. Relative to \n",
      "prices overall, however, it is actually lower. Therefore, we must be careful to \n",
      "correct for inflation when comparing prices across time. This means measuring \n",
      "prices in real rather than nominal terms. \n",
      "The nominal price of a good (sometimes called its \"current-dollar\" price) is \n",
      "its absolute price. For example, the nominal price of a pound of butter was about \n",
      "$0.87 in 1970, $1.88 in 1980, about $1.99 in 1990, and about $3.48 in 2015. These \n",
      "are the prices you would have seen in supermarkets in those years. The real price \n",
      "of a good (sometimes called its \"constant-dollar\" price) is the price relative to an \n",
      "aggregate measure of prices. In other words, it is the price adjusted for inflation. \n",
      "For consumer goods, the aggregate measure of prices most often used is the \n",
      "Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI is calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor \n",
      "Statistics by surveying retail prices, and is published monthly. It records how the cost \n",
      "of a large market basket of goods purchased by a \"typical\" consumer changes over \n",
      "time. Percentage changes in the CPI measure the rate of inflation in the economy. \n",
      "Sometimes we are interested in the prices of raw materials and other in­\n",
      "termediate products bought by firms, as well as in finished products sold at \n",
      "wholesale to retail stores. In this case, the aggregate measure of prices often \n",
      "used is the Producer Price Index (PPI). The PPI is also calculated by the U.S. \n",
      "Bureau of Labor Statistics and published monthly, and records how, on aver­\n",
      "age, prices at the wholesale level change over time. Percentage changes in the \n",
      "PPI measure cost inflation and predict future changes in the CPI. \n",
      "So which price index should you use to convert nominal prices to real prices? \n",
      "It depends on the type of product you are examining. If it is a product or service \n",
      "normally purchased by consumers, use the CPI. If instead it is a product nor­\n",
      "mally purchased by businesses, use the PPL \n",
      "Because we are examining the price of butter in supermarkets, the relevant \n",
      "price index is the CPI. After correcting for inflation, do we find that the price of \n",
      "butter was more expensive in 2015 than in 1970? To find out, let's calculate the \n",
      "2015 price of butter in terms of 1970 dollars. The CPI was 38.8 in 1970 and rose \n",
      "to about 237.0 in 2015. (There was considerable inflation in the United States \n",
      "during the 1970s and early 1980s.) In 1970 dollars, the price of butter was \n",
      "38·8 X $3.48 = $0.57 237.0 \n",
      "In real terms, therefore, the price of butter was lower in 2015 than it was in 1970.5 Put \n",
      "another way, the nominal price of butter went up by about 300 percent, while the \n",
      "CPI went up 511 percent. Relative to the aggregate price level, butter prices fell. \n",
      "In this book, we will usually be concerned with real rather than nominal \n",
      "prices because consumer choices involve analyses of price comparisons. These \n",
      "relative prices can most easily be evaluated if there is a common basis of com­\n",
      "parison. Stating all prices in real terms achieves this objective. Thus, even \n",

      "EXAMPLE 1.4 THE AUTHORS DEBATE THE MINIMUM WAGE \n",
      "Many workers in the United States are dissatisfied. \n",
      "They feel that their wages have not grown in the past \n",
      "two decades, and are finding it hard to make ends \n",
      "meet. This is especially the case for unskilled work­\n",
      "ers, many of whom earn the minimum wage. As a re­\n",
      "sult, some economists and politicians have proposed \n",
      "raising the minimum wage, while others argue that \n",
      "doing so would lead to fewer jobs for teenagers and \n",
      "other new entrants into the labor market. So what to \n",
      "do? Should the minimum wage be increased? \n",
      "\"Leave it where it is,\" says Pindyck. \"It has been \n",
      "raised regularly since it was first introduced in 1938 \n",
      "(at $0.25 per hour), and is much higher than it was \n",
      "just a decade or two ago.\" \"Wait,\" shouts Rubinfeld . \n",
      "You are ignoring inflation, and confusing the nomi­\n",
      "nal minimum wage and the real (inflation-adjusted) \n",
      "minimum wage. Just look at Figure 1.1, which shows \n",
      "the minimum wage in both nominal and real terms. \n",
      "In real terms, the minimum wage is actually much \n",
      "lower than it was during the 1970s.\" \n",
      "\"Good point,\" replies Pindyck. \"As we tell our \n",
      "students, one should never ignore inflation. I hate to say it, but you are right on this one. It is the \n",
      "real minimum wage that matters, and that has in­\n",
      "deed been declining .\" \"But,\" adds Pindyck, \"there \n",
      "are two points you shouldn't forget. First, many \n",
      "states have a minimum wage that is significantly \n",
      "higher than the federal minimum . For example, \n",
      "California's 2016 minimum wage of $10 and New \n",
      "York's $9 minimum are substantially higher than \n",
      "the federal minimum (in 2016) of $7.25. Second \n",
      "and probably more important, the minimum wage \n",

      "Corporate Decision Making: The Toyota Prius \n",
      "In 1997, Toyota Motor Corporation introduced the Prius in Japan, and started \n",
      "selling it worldwide in 2001. The Prius, the first hybrid car to be sold in the \n",
      "United States, can run off both a gasoline engine and a battery, and the momen­\n",
      "tum of the car charges the battery. Hybrid cars are more energy efficient than \n",
      "cars with just a gasoline engine; the Prius, for example, can get 45 to 55 miles \n",
      "per gallon. The Prius was a big success, and within a few years other manufac­\n",
      "turers began introducing hybrid versions of some of their cars. \n",
      "The design and efficient production of the Prius involved not only some im­\n",
      "pressive engineering, but a lot of economics as well. First, Toyota had to think care­\n",
      "fully about how the public would react to the design and performance of this new \n",
      "product. How strong would demand be initially, and how fast would it grow? \n",
      "How would demand depend on the prices that Toyota charged? Understanding \n",
      "consumer preferences and trade-offs and predicting demand and its responsive­\n",
      "ness to price are essential to Toyota and every other automobile manufacturer. (We \n",
      "discuss consumer preferences and demand in Chapters 3, 4, and 5.) \n",
      "Next, Toyota had to be concerned with the cost of manufacturing these cars -\n",
      "whether produced in Japan or, starting in 2010, in the United States. How high \n",
      "would production costs be? How would the cost of each car depend on the total \n",
      "number of cars produced each year? How would the cost of labor and the prices \n",
      "of steel and other raw materials affect costs? How much and how fast would \n",
      "costs decline as managers and workers gained experience with the production \n",
      "process? And to maximize profits, how many of these cars should Toyota plan to \n",
      "produce each year? (We discuss production and cost in Chapters 6 and 7, and the \n",
      "profit-maximizing choice of output in Chapters 8 and 10.) \n",
      "Toyota also had to design a pricing strategy and consider how competitors \n",
      "would react to it. Although the Prius was the first hybrid car, Toyota knew \n",
      "that it would compete with other small fuel-efficient cars, and that soon other \n",
      "manufacturers would introduce their own hybrid cars. Should Toyota charge \n",
      "a relatively low price for a basic stripped-down version of the Prius and high \n",
      "prices for individual options like leather seats? Or would it be more profitable \n",
      "to make these options \"standard\" items and charge a higher price for the whole \n",
      "package? Whatever pricing strategy Toyota chose, how were competitors likely \n",
      "to react? Would Ford or Nissan try to undercut by lowering the prices of its \n",
      "smaller cars, or rush to bring out their own hybrid cars at lower prices? Might \n",
      "Toyota be able to deter Ford and Nissan from lowering prices by threatening to \n",
      "respond with its own price cuts? (We discuss pricing in Chapters 10 and 11, and \n",
      "competitive strategy in Chapters 12 and 13.) \n",
      "Manufacturing the Prius required large investments in new capital equip­\n",
      "ment, so Toyota had to consider both the risks and possible outcomes of its \n",
      "decisions. Some of this risk was due to uncertainty over the future price of \n",
      "oil and thus the price of gasoline (lower gasoline prices would reduce the \n",
      "18 PART 1 Introduction : Markets and Prices \n",
      "demand for small fuel-efficient cars). Some of the risk was due to uncertainty \n",
      "over the wages that Toyota would have to pay its workers at its plants in Japan \n",
      "and in the United States. (Oil and other commodity markets are discussed in \n",
      "Chapters 2 and 9. Labor markets and the impact of unions are discussed in \n",

      "Toyota also had to worry about organizational problems. Toyota is an inte­\n",

      "receives from another division? (We discuss internal pricing and organizational \n",
      "incentives for the integrated firm in Chapters 11 and 17.) \n",
      "Finally, Toyota had to think about its relationship to the government and the \n",
      "effects of regulatory policies. For example, all of its cars sold in the United States \n",
      "must meet federal emissions standards, and U.S. production-line operations must \n",
      "comply with health and safety regulations. How might those regulations and \n",

      "SUMMARY \n",
      "1. Microeconomics is concerned with the decisions made \n",
      "by individual economic units---consumers, workers, \n",
      "investors, owners of resources, and business firms. It \n",
      "is also concerned with the interaction of consumers \n",
      "and firms to form markets and industries. \n",
      "2. Microeconomics relies heavily on the use of theory, \n",
      "which can (by simplification) help to explain how \n",
      "economic units behave and to predict what behavior \n",
      "will occur in the future. Models are mathematical rep­\n",
      "resentations of theories that can help in this explana­\n",
      "tion and prediction process. \n",
      "3. Microeconomics is concerned with positive questions \n",
      "that have to do with the explanation and prediction of \n",
      "phenomena. But microeconomics is also important for \n",
      "normative analysis, in which we ask what choices are \n",
      "best-for a firm or for society as a whole. Normative \n",
      "analyses must often be combined with individual \n",
      "value judgments because issues of equity and fairness \n",
      "as well as of economic efficiency may be involved. \n",
      "4. A market refers to a collection of buyers and sellers who \n",
      "interact, and to the possibility for sales and purchases \n",
      "QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW \n",
      "1. It is often said that a good theory is one that can be \n",
      "refuted by an empirical, data-oriented study. Explain \n",
      "why a theory that cannot be evaluated empirically is \n",
      "not a good theory. \n",
      "2. Which of the following two statements involves posi­\n",
      "tive economic analysis and which normative? How do \n",
      "the two kinds of analysis differ? that result from that interaction . Microeconomics in­\n",
      "volves the study of both perfectly competitive mar­\n",
      "kets, in which no single buyer or seller has an impact \n",
      "on price, and noncompetitive markets, in which indi­\n",
      "vidual entities can affect price. \n",
      "5. The market price is established by the interaction of \n",
      "buyers and sellers. In a perfectly competitive market, \n",
      "a single price will usually prevail. In markets that \n",
      "are not perfectly competitive, different sellers might \n",
      "charge different prices. In this case, the market price \n",
      "refers to the average prevailing price. \n",
      "6. When discussing a market, we must be clear about \n",
      "its extent in terms of both its geographic boundaries \n",
      "and the range of products to be included in it. Some \n",
      "markets (e.g., housing) are highly localized, whereas \n",
      "others (e.g., gold) are global in nature. \n",
      "7. To account for the effects of inflation, we measure \n",
      "real (or constant-dollar) prices, rather than nominal \n",
      "(or current-dollar) prices. Real prices use an ag­\n",
      "gregate price index, such as the CPI, to correct for \n",
      "inflation . \n",
      "a. Gasoline rationing (allocating to each individual \n",
      "a maximum amount of gasoline that can be pur­\n",
      "chased each year) is poor social policy because it \n",
      "interferes with the workings of the competitive \n",

      "The Basics of Supply \n",
      "and Demand \n",
      "One of the best ways to appreciate the relevance of economics \n",
      "is to begin with the basics of supply and demand. Supply­\n",
      "demand analysis is a fundamental and powerful tool that can \n",
      "be applied to a wide variety of interesting and important problems. To \n",
      "name a few: \n",
      "• Understanding and predicting how changing world economic con­\n",

      "• Evaluating the impact of government price controls, minimum \n",
      "wages, price supports, and production incentives \n",
      "• Determining how taxes, subsidies, tariffs, and import quotas affect \n",
      "consumers and producers \n",
      "We begin with a review of how supply and demand curves are used \n",
      "to describe the market mechanism. Without government intervention \n",
      "(e.g., through the imposition of price controls or some other regulatory \n",
      "policy), supply and demand will come into equilibrium to determine \n",
      "both the market price of a good and the total quantity produced. What \n",

      "The Supply Curve \n",
      "The supply curve shows the quantity of a good that producers are willing to \n",
      "sell at a given price, holding constant any other factors that might affect the \n",
      "quantity supplied. The curve labeled S in Figure 2.1 illustrates this. The verti­\n",
      "cal axis of the graph shows the price of a good, P, measured in dollars per unit. \n",
      "This is the price that sellers receive for a given quantity supplied. The horizon­\n",
      "tal axis shows the total quantity supplied, Q, measured in the number of units \n",

      "The supply curve is thus a relationship between the quantity supplied and \n",
      "the price. We can write this relationship as an equation: \n",
      "Qs = Qs(P) \n",
      "Or we can draw it graphically, as we have done in Figure 2.1. \n",
      "Note that the supply curve in Figure 2.1 slopes upward. In other words, the \n",
      "higher the price, the more that firms are able and willing to produce and sell. For \n",
      "example, a higher price may enable current firms to expand production by \n",
      "hiring extra workers or by having existing workers work overtime (at greater \n",

      "OTHER VARIABLES THAT AFFECT SUPPLY The quantity supplied can de­\n",

      "their production costs, including wages, interest charges, and the costs of raw \n",

      "values of these other variables. A change in the values of one or more of these \n",
      "variables translates into a shift in the supply curve. Let's see how this might \n",
      "happen. \n",
      "The supply curve S in Figure 2.1 says that at a price P1, the quantity pro­\n",
      "duced and sold would be Q1. Now suppose that the cost of raw materials falls. \n",
      "How does this affect the supply curve? \n",
      "Lower raw material costs-indeed, lower costs of any kind-make production \n",
      "more profitable, encouraging existing firms to expand production and enabling \n",
      "new firms to enter the market. If at the same time the market price stayed con­\n",
      "stant at P1, we would expect to observe a greater quantity supplied. Figure 2.1 \n",
      "shows this as an increase from Q1 to Q2. When production costs decrease, output \n",
      "increases no matter what the market price happens to be. The entire supply curve \n",
      "thus shifts to the right, which is shown in the figure as a shift from S to S '. \n",
      "Another way of looking at the effect of lower raw material costs is to imag­\n",
      "ine that the quantity produced stays fixed at Q1 and then ask what price firms \n",
      "would require to produce this quantity. Because their costs are lower, they \n",
      "would accept a lower price-P 2. This would be the case no matter what quan­\n",

      "to the right. \n",
      "We have seen that the response of quantity supplied to changes in price can \n",
      "be represented by movements along the supply curve. However, the response of \n",

      "Goods are complements when an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease \n",
      "in the quantity demanded of the other. For example, automobiles and gasoline are \n",

      "price of gasoline increases the quantity demanded for automobiles. Likewise, com­\n",
      "puters and computer software are complementary goods. The price of computers \n",
      "has dropped dramatically over the past decade, fueling an increase not only in \n",
      "purchases of computers, but also purchases of software packages. \n",
      "We attributed the shift to the right of the demand curve in Figure 2.2 to an \n",

      "if a market is at least roughly competitive. By this we mean that both sellers and \n",
      "buyers should have little market power-i.e., little ability individually to affect the \n",
      "market price. \n",
      "Suppose instead that supply were controlled by a single producer-a \n",
      "monopolist. In this case, there will no longer be a simple one-to-one relation­\n",
      "ship between price and the quantity supplied. Why? Because a monopolist's \n",
      "behavior depends on the shape and position of the demand curve. If the \n",
      "demand curve shifts in a particular way, it may be in the monopolist's interest \n",
      "to keep the quantity fixed but change the price, or to keep the price fixed and \n",
      "change the quantity. (How this could occur is explained in Chapter 10.) Thus \n",
      "when we work with supply and demand curves, we implicitly assume that we \n",
      "are referring to a competitive market. \n",
      "2.3 Changes in Market Equilibrium \n",
      "We have seen how supply and demand curves shift in response to changes in \n",
      "such variables as wage rates, capital costs, and income. We have also seen how \n",
      "the market mechanism results in an equilibrium in which the quantity supplied \n",
      "equals the quantity demanded. Now we will see how that equilibrium changes \n",
      "in response to shifts in the supply and demand curves. \n",
      "Let's begin with a shift in the supply curve. In Figure 2.4, the supply curve \n",
      "has shifted from S to S' (as it did in Figure 2.1), perhaps as a result of a de­\n",
      "crease in the price of raw materials. As a result, the market price drops (from \n",
      "P1 to P3), and the total quantity produced increases (from Q1 to Q3). This is \n",

      "In most markets, both the demand and supply curves shift from time to time. \n",
      "Consumers' disposable incomes change as the economy grows (or contracts, \n",

      "We have seen that the demand for a good depends not only on its price, but also \n",
      "on consumer income and on the prices of other goods. Likewise, supply de­\n",
      "pends both on price and on variables that affect production cost. For example, \n",
      "if the price of coffee increases, the quantity demanded will fall and the quantity \n",
      "supplied will rise. Often, however, we want to know how much the quantity \n",
      "supplied or demanded will rise or fall. How sensitive is the demand for coffee \n",
      "to its price? If price increases by 10 percent, how much will the quantity de­\n",
      "manded change? How much will it change if income rises by 5 percent? We use \n",
      "elasticities to answer questions like these. \n",
      "An elasticity measures the sensitivity of one variable to another. Specifically, \n",
      "it is a number that tells us the percentage change that will occur in one variable in \n",
      "response to a 1-percent increase in another variable. For example, the price elasticity of \n",
      "demand measures the sensitivity of quantity demanded to price changes. It tells \n",
      "us what the percentage change in the quantity demanded for a good will be fol­\n",
      "lowing a 1-percent increase in the price of that good. \n",
      "PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND Let's look at this in more detail. We write the \n",
      "price elasticity of demand, Ep, as \n",
      "Ep = (%LiQ)/(%LiP) \n",
      "where %LiQ means \"percentage change in quantity demanded\" and %LiP means \n",
      "\"percentage change in price.\" (The symbol Li is the Greek capital letter delta; it \n",
      "means \"the change in.\" So LiX means \"the change in the variable X,\" say, from \n",
      "one year to the next.) The percentage change in a variable is just the absolute change \n",
      "in the variable divided by the original level of the variable. (If the Consumer Price Index \n",
      "were 200 at the beginning of the year and increased to 204 by the end of the year, \n",
      "the percentage change-or annual rate of inflation-would be 4/200 = .02, or 2 \n",
      "percent.) Thus we can also write the price elasticity of demand as follows? \n",
      "PLiQ \n",
      "QLiP (2.1) \n",
      "The price elasticity of demand is usually a negative number. When the price \n",
      "of a good increases, the quantity demanded usually falls. Thus LiQ/ LiP (the \n",
      "change in quantity for a change in price) is negative, as is Ep. Sometimes we \n",
      "refer to the magnitude of the price elasticity-i.e., its absolute size. For example, \n",
      "if Ep = -2, we say that the elasticity is 2 in magnitude. \n",
      "When the price elasticity is greater than 1 in magnitude, we say that demand \n",
      "is price elastic because the percentage decline in quantity demanded is greater \n",
      "than the percentage increase in price. If the price elasticity is less than 1 in \n",
      "magnitude, demand is said to be price inelastic. In general, the price elasticity of \n",
      "demand for a good depends on the availability of other goods that can be sub­\n",
      "stituted for it. When there are close substitutes, a price increase will cause the \n",
      "consumer to buy less of the good and more of the substitute. Demand will then \n",
      "be highly price elastic. When there are no close substitutes, demand will tend to \n",
      "be price inelastic. \n",

      "times the ratio of price to quantity (P/Q). But as we move down the demand \n",
      "curve, LiQ/ LiP may change, and the price and quantity will always change. \n",
      "Therefore, the price elasticity of demand must be measured at a particular point \n",
      "on the demand curve and will generally change as we move along the curve. \n",
      "This principle is easiest to see for a linear demand curve-that is, a demand \n",

      "For this curve, LiQ/ LiP is constant and equal to -2 (a LiP of 1 results in a LiQ \n",
      "of -2). However, the curve does not have a constant elasticity. Observe from \n",
      "Figure 2.11 that as we move down the curve, the ratio PI Q falls; the elastic­\n",

      "Ep = 0. \n",

      "positive because a higher price gives producers an incentive to increase output. \n",

      "interest rates, wage rates, and the prices of raw materials and other intermedi­\n",
      "ate goods used to manufacture the product in question. For example, for most \n",
      "manufactured goods, the elasticities of supply with respect to the prices of raw \n",

      "higher costs for the firm; other things being equal, therefore, the quantity sup­\n",

      "Point versus Arc Elasticities \n",
      "So far, we have considered elasticities at a particular point on the demand curve \n",
      "or the supply curve. These are called point elasticities. The point elasticity of \n",
      "demand, for example, is the price elasticity of demand at a particular point on the de­\n",
      "mand curve and is defined by Equation (2.1). As we demonstrated in Figure 2.11 \n",
      "using a linear demand curve, the point elasticity of demand can vary depend­\n",
      "ing on where it is measured along the demand curve. \n",
      "There are times, however, when we want to calculate a price elasticity over \n",
      "some portion of the demand curve (or supply curve) rather than at a single \n",
      "point. Suppose, for example, that we are contemplating an increase in the \n",
      "price of a product from $8.00 to $10.00 and expect the quantity demanded \n",
      "to fall from 6 units to 4. How should we calculate the price elasticity of de­\n",
      "mand? Is the price increase 25 percent (a $2 increase divided by the original \n",
      "price of $8), or is it 20 percent (a $2 increase divided by the new price of $10)? \n",
      "Is the percentage decrease in quantity demanded 33 1/3 percent (2/6) or \n",
      "50 percent (2/ 4)? \n",
      "There is no correct answer to such questions. We could calculate the price \n",
      "elasticity using the original price and quantity. If so, we would find that \n",
      "Ep = (-33 1 /3 percent/25 percent) = -1.33. Or we could use the new price \n",
      "and quantity, in which case we would find that Ep = (-50 percent/20 percent) \n",
      "= -2 .5. The difference between these two calculated elasticities is large, and \n",
      "neither seems preferable to the other. \n",
      "ARC ELASTICITY OF DEMAND We can resolve this problem by using the \n",
      "arc elasticity of demand: the elasticity calculated over a range of prices. Rather \n",
      "than choose either the initial or the final price, we use an average of the two, \n",

      "(demand by U.S. consumers) and export (demand by foreign consumers) . \n",
      "During the past 30 years, domestic demand for wheat rose only slightly \n",
      "(due to modest increases in population and income). Export demand, \n",
      "however, fell sharply. There were several reasons. First and foremost was \n",
      "the success of the Green Revolution in agriculture : Developing countries \n",

      "and the long run. In other words, if we ask how much demand or supply changes \n",
      "in response to a change in price, we must be clear about haw much time is allowed \n",
      "to pass before we measure the changes in the quantity demanded or supplied. If we allow \n",
      "only a short time to pass-say, one year or less-then we are dealing with the \n",
      "short run. When we refer to the long run we mean that enough time is allowed for \n",
      "consumers or producers to adjust fully to the price change. In general, short-run \n",
      "demand and supply curves look very different from their long-run counterparts. \n",
      "Demand \n",
      "For many goods, demand is much more price elastic in the long run than in the short \n",
      "run. For one thing, it takes time for people to change their consumption habits. For \n",
      "example, even if the price of coffee rises sharply, the quantity demanded will fall \n",
      "only gradually as consumers begin to drink less. In addition, the demand for a good \n",
      "might be linked to the stock of another good that changes only slowly. For example, \n",
      "the demand for gasoline is much more elastic in the long run than in the short run. A \n",
      "sharply higher price of gasoline reduces the quantity demanded in the short run by \n",
      "causing motorists to drive less, but it has its greatest impact on demand by inducing \n",
      "consumers to buy smaller and more fuel-efficient cars. But because the stock of cars \n",

      "Because these goods (automobiles, refrigerators, televisions, or the capital \n",

      "What is the result? At this lower price, producers (particularly those with higher \n",

      "SUMMARY \n",
      "1. Supply-demand analysis is a basic tool of microeco­\n",
      "nomics. In competitive markets, supply and demand \n",
      "curves tell us how much will be produced by firms \n",
      "and how much will be demanded by consumers as a \n",
      "function of price. \n",
      "2. The market mechanism is the tendency for supply and \n",
      "demand to equilibrate (i.e., for price to move to the \n",
      "market-clearing level), so that there is neither excess \n",
      "demand nor excess supply. The equilibrium price is \n",
      "the price that equates the quantity demanded with the \n",
      "quantity supplied . \n",
      "3. Elasticities describe the responsiveness of supply and \n",
      "demand to changes in price, income, or other vari­\n",
      "ables. For example, the price elasticity of demand \n",
      "measures the percentage change in the quantity de­\n",
      "manded resulting from a 1-percent increase in price. \n",
      "4. Elasticities pertain to a time frame, and for most goods \n",
      "it is important to distinguish between short-run and \n",
      "long-run elasticities . \n",
      "5. We can use supply-demand diagrams to see how \n",
      "shifts in the supply curve and/ or demand curve can \n",
      "explain changes in the market price and quantity. \n",
      "QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW \n",
      "1. Suppose that unusually hot weather causes the demand \n",
      "curve for ice cream to shift to the right. Why will the \n",
      "price of ice cream rise to a new market-clearing level? \n",
      "2. Use supply and demand curves to illustrate how each \n",
      "of the following events would affect the price of butter \n",
      "and the quantity of butter bought and sold: (a) an in­\n",
      "crease in the price of margarine; (b) an increase in the \n",
      "price of milk; (c) a decrease in average income levels. \n",
      "3. If a 3-percent increase in the price of com flakes causes \n",
      "a 6-percent decline in the quantity demanded, what is \n",
      "the elasticity of demand? \n",
      "4. Explain the difference between a shift in the supply \n",
      "curve and a movement along the supply curve. \n",
      "5. Explain why for many goods, the long-run price elas­\n",
      "ticity of supply is larger than the short-run elasticity. \n",
      "6. Why do long-run elasticities of demand differ from \n",
      "short-run elasticities? Consider two goods: paper towels \n",
      "and televisions . Which is a durable good? Would you \n",
      "expect the price elasticity of demand for paper towels to \n",
      "be larger in the short run or in the long run? Why? What \n",
      "about the price elasticity of demand for televisions? \n",
      "7. Are the following statements true or false? Explain \n",
      "your answers. \n",
      "a. The elasticity of demand is the same as the slope \n",
      "of the demand curve. \n",
      "b. The cross-price elasticity will always be positive. \n",
      "c. The supply of apartments is more inelastic in the \n",
      "short run than the long run. 6. If we can estimate, at least roughly, the supply and \n",
      "demand curves for a particular market, we can calcu­\n",
      "late the market-clearing price by equating the quan­\n",
      "tity supplied with the quantity demanded. Also, if \n",
      "we know how supply and demand depend on other \n",
      "economic variables, such as income or the prices of \n",
      "other goods, we can calculate how the market-clearing \n",
      "price and quantity will change as these other variables \n",
      "change. This is a means of explaining or predicting \n",
      "market behavior . \n",

      "Market Baskets \n",
      "We use the term market basket to refer to such a group of items. Specifically, a \n",

      "Table 3.1 shows several market baskets consisting of various amounts of \n",

      "Some Basic Assumptions about Preferences \n",
      "The theory of consumer behavior begins with three basic assumptions about \n",
      "people's preferences for one market basket versus another. We believe that \n",
      "these assumptions hold for most people in most situations. \n",
      "1. Completeness: Preferences are assumed to be complete. In other words, \n",
      "consumers can compare and rank all possible baskets. Thus, for any two \n",
      "market baskets A and B, a consumer will prefer A to B, will prefer B to A, \n",
      "or will be indifferent between the two. By indifferent we mean that a per­\n",
      "son will be equally satisfied with either basket. Note that these preferences \n",
      "ignore costs. A consumer might prefer steak to hamburger but buy ham­\n",
      "burger because it is cheaper. \n",
      "2. Transitivity: Preferences are transitive. Transitivity means that if a con­\n",
      "sumer prefers basket A to basket B and basket B to basket C, then the \n",
      "consumer also prefers A to C. For example, if a Porsche is preferred to a \n",
      "Cadillac and a Cadillac to a Chevrolet, then a Porsche is also preferred to \n",
      "a Chevrolet. Transitivity is normally regarded as necessary for consumer \n",
      "consistency. \n",
      "3. More is better than less: Goods are assumed to be desirable-i.e., to \n",
      "be good. Consequently, consumers always prefer more of any good to less. In \n",
      "addition, consumers are never satisfied or satiated; more is always better, \n",
      "even if just a little better.1 This assumption is made for pedagogic reasons; \n",
      "namely, it simplifies the graphical analysis. Of course, some goods, such \n",
      "as air pollution, may be undesirable, and consumers will always prefer \n",
      "less. We ignore these \"bads\" in the context of our immediate discussion of \n",
      "consumer choice because most consumers would not choose to purchase \n",
      "them. We will, however, discuss them later in the chapter. \n",
      "These three assumptions form the basis of consumer theory. They do not ex­\n",
      "plain consumer preferences, but they do impose a degree of rationality and \n",
      "reasonableness on them. Building on these assumptions, we will now explore \n",

      "Given our three assumptions about preferences, we know that a consumer \n",
      "can always indicate either a preference for one market basket over another \n",
      "or indifference between the two. We can then use this information to rank all \n",
      "possible consumption choices. In order to appreciate this principle in graphic \n",

      "food F and clothing C. In this case, all market baskets describe combinations \n",

      "4. Indifference curves, which represent all combinations \n",

      "one another. \n",
      "5. Consumer preferences can be completely described \n",
      "by a set of indifference curves known as an indiffer­\n",
      "ence map. An indifference map provides an ordinal \n",
      "ranking of all choices that the consumer might make. \n",
      "6. The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of F for C is \n",
      "the maximum amount of C that a person is willing \n",

      "diminishes as we move down along an indifference \n",

      "flourishing field of behavioral economics, which, by introducing important ideas \n",
      "from psychology, has broadened and enriched the study of microeconomics. \n",
      "5 .1 Describing Risk \n",
      "To describe risk quantitatively, we begin by listing all the possible outcomes \n",
      "of a particular action or event, as well as the likelihood that each outcome will \n",
      "occur.1 Suppose, for example, that you are considering investing in a company \n",
      "that explores for offshore oil. If the exploration effort is successful, the com­\n",
      "pany's stock will increase from $30 to $40 per share; if not, the price will fall \n",
      "to $20 per share. Thus there are two possible future outcomes: a $40-per-share \n",
      "price and a $20-per-share price. \n",
      "Probability \n",
      "Probability is the likelihood that a given outcome will occur. In our example, \n",
      "the probability that the oil exploration project will be successful might be 1/ 4 \n",
      "and the probability that it is unsuccessful 3/ 4. (Note that the probabilities for all \n",
      "possible events must add up to 1.) \n",
      "Our interpretation of probability can depend on the nature of the uncertain \n",
      "event, on the beliefs of the people involved, or both. One objective interpretation \n",
      "of probability relies on the frequency with which certain events tend to occur. \n",
      "Suppose we know that of the last 100 offshore oil explorations, 25 have suc­\n",
      "ceeded and 75 failed. In that case, the probability of success of 1 / 4 is objective \n",
      "because it is based directly on the frequency of similar experiences. \n",
      "But what if there are no similar past experiences to help measure probability? \n",
      "In such instances, objective measures of probability cannot be deduced and more \n",
      "subjective measures are needed. Subjective probability is the perception that an out­\n",
      "come will occur. This perception may be based on a person's judgment or experi­\n",
      "ence, but not necessarily on the frequency with which a particular outcome has \n",
      "actually occurred in the past. When probabilities are subjectively determined, dif­\n",
      "ferent people may attach different probabilities to different outcomes and thereby \n",
      "make different choices. For example, if the search for oil were to take place in an \n",
      "area where no previous searches had ever occurred, I might attach a higher sub­\n",
      "jective probability than you to the chance that the project will succeed: Perhaps \n",
      "I know more about the project or I have a better understanding of the oil business \n",
      "and can therefore make better use of our common information. Either different \n",
      "information or different abilities to process the same information can cause sub­\n",
      "jective probabilities to vary among individuals. \n",
      "Regardless of the interpretation of probability, it is used in calculating two \n",
      "important measures that help us describe and compare risky choices. One \n",
      "measure tells us the expected value and the other the variability of the possible \n",
      "outcomes. \n",
      "1Some people distinguish between uncertainty and risk along the lines suggested some 60 years ago \n",
      "by economist Frank Knight. Uncertainty can refer to situations in which many outcomes are possible \n",
      "but the likelihood of each is unknown. Risk then refers to situations in which we can list all possible \n",
      "outcomes and know the likelihood of each occurring . In this chapter, we will always refer to risky \n",
      "situations, but will simplify the discussion by using uncertainty and risk interchangeably . \n",

      "The probabilities of each outcome are used as weights. Thus the expected \n",
      "value measures the central tendency-the payoff or value that we would expect \n",
      "on average. \n",
      "Our offshore oil exploration example had two possible outcomes: Success \n",

      "ing between two part-time summer sales jobs that have the same expected \n",
      "income ($1500). The first job is based entirely on commission-the income \n",

      "for this job: $2000 for a successful sales effort and $1000 for one that is less \n",

      "market basket that the consumer's income can buy. We now measure payoffs, \n",
      "therefore, in terms of utility rather than dollars. \n",
      "Figure 5.3 (a) shows how we can describe one woman's preferences toward \n",
      "risk. The curve OE, which gives her utility function, tells us the level of utility \n",
      "(on the vertical axis) that she can attain for each level of income (measured in \n",
      "thousands of dollars on the horizontal axis). The level of utility increases from \n",
      "10 to 16 to 18 as income increases from $10,000 to $20,000 to $30,000. But note \n",
      "that marginal utility is diminishing, falling from 10 when income increases from \n",
      "0 to $10,000, to 6 when income increases from $10,000 to $20,000, and to 2 when \n",

      "Now suppose that our consumer has an income of $15,000 and is considering \n",
      "a new but risky sales job that will either double her income to $30,000 or cause it \n",
      "to fall to $10,000. Each possibility has a probability of .5. As Figure 5.3 (a) shows, \n",
      "the utility level associated with an income of $10,000 is 10 (at point A) and the \n",
      "utility level associated with an income of $30,000 is 18 (at E). The risky job must \n",
      "be compared with the current $15,000 job, for which the utility is 13.5 (at B). \n",
      "To evaluate the new job, she can calculate the expected value of the resulting \n",
      "income. Because we are measuring value in terms of her utility, we must calcu­\n",

      "For a risk-averse person, losses are more important (in terms of the change in \n",

      "tendency of the values of risky outcomes . Variability \n",
      "is frequently measured by the standard deviation of \n",
      "outcomes, which is the square root of the probability­\n",
      "weighted average of the squares of the deviation from \n",
      "the expected value of each possible outcome. \n",

      "ishing marginal returns to labor by drawing a horizontal line at a particular \n",
      "level of capital-say, 3. Reading the levels of output from each isoquant as \n",
      "labor is increased, we note that each additional unit of labor generates less \n",
      "and less additional output. For example, when labor is increased from 1 unit \n",
      "to 2 (from A to B), output increases by 20 (from 55 to 75). However, when la­\n",
      "bor is increased by an additional unit (from B to C), output increases by only \n",
      "15 (from 75 to 90). Thus there are diminishing marginal returns to labor both \n",
      "in the long and short run. Because adding one factor while holding the other \n",

      "isoquant must become steeper as more capital is added in place of labor and \n",
      "flatter when labor is added in place of capital. \n",
      "There are also diminishing marginal returns to capital. With labor fixed, the \n",
      "marginal product of capital decreases as capital is increased. For example, when \n",
      "capital is increased from 1 to 2 and labor is held constant at 3, the marginal \n",

      "Substitution Among Inputs \n",
      "With two inputs that can be varied, a manager will want to consider substitut­\n",
      "ing one input for another. The slope of each isoquant indicates how the quantity \n",
      "of one input can be traded off against the quantity of the other, while output \n",
      "is held constant. When the negative sign is removed, we call the slope the \n",
      "marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS). The marginal rate of technical \n",
      "substitution of labor for capital is the amount by which the input of capital can be \n",
      "reduced when one extra unit of labor is used, so that output remains constant. \n",
      "This is analogous to the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) in consumer theory. \n",
      "Recall from Section 3.1 that the MRS describes how consumers substitute \n",
      "CHAPTER 6 PRODUCTION 205 \n",
      "among two goods while holding the level of satisfaction constant. Like the \n",
      "MRS, the MRTS is always measured as a positive quantity: \n",

      "= -LiK/LlL(for a fixed level of q) \n",
      "where LlK and LlL are small changes in capital and labor along an isoquant. \n",
      "In Figure 6.6 the MRTS is equal to 2 when labor increases from 1 unit to 2 \n",
      "and output is fixed at 75. However, the MRTS falls to 1 when labor is increased \n",
      "from 2 units to 3, and then declines to 2/3 and to 1/3. Clearly, as more and more \n",
      "labor replaces capital, labor becomes less productive and capital becomes rela­\n",
      "tively more productive. Therefore, we need less capital to keep output constant, \n",
      "and the isoquant becomes flatter. \n",
      "DIMINISHING MRTS We assume that there is a diminishing MRTS. In other \n",

      "Opportunity Cost \n",
      "Opportunity cost is the cost associated with opportunities that are forgone \n",

      "cost of utilizing the office space. And because the office space is a resource that \n",
      "the firm is utilizing, this opportunity cost is also an economic cost of doing \n",
      "business. \n",
      "What about the wages and salaries paid to the firm's workers? This is clearly \n",

      "• Variable cost (VC): A cost that varies as output varies. \n",
      "Depending on circumstances, fixed costs may include expenditures for plant \n",

      "Fixed cost does not vary with the level of output-it must be paid even if \n",

      "outside suppliers in quantities that depend on the \n",
      "number of computers to be produced . \n",
      "Another important variable cost is labor: Workers \n",
      "are needed to assemble computers and then package \n",

      "In this case, the price of labor is simply the wage rate, w. But what about the \n",

      "THE PRICE OF CAPITAL In the long run, the firm can adjust the amount of \n",
      "capital it uses. Even if the capital includes specialized machinery that has no \n",
      "alternative use, expenditures on this machinery are not yet sunk and must \n",

      "capital are necessary. In order to compare the firm's expenditure on capital \n",
      "with its ongoing cost of labor, we want to express this capital expenditure as \n",
      "a flow---e.g., in dollars per year. To do this, we must amortize the expenditure \n",

      "THE RENTAL RATE OF CAPITAL As we noted, capital is often rented rather \n",

      "Suppose we begin with an output of 100 units. The point of tangency of the \n",

      "ing, services, and financial markets. Because this model is so important, we will \n",
      "spend some time laying out the basic assumptions that underlie it. \n",
      "The model of perfect competition rests on three basic assumptions: (1) price \n",

      "tered these assumptions earlier in the book; here we summarize and elaborate \n",
      "on them. \n",
      "PRICE TAKING Because many firms compete in the market, each firm faces a \n",
      "significant number of direct competitors for its products. Because each individual \n",
      "firm sells a sufficiently small proportion of total market output, its decisions have no \n",
      "impact on market price. Thus, each firm takes the market price as given. In short, \n",
      "firms in perfectly competitive markets are price takers . \n",
      "Suppose, for example, that you are the owner of a small electric lightbulb \n",
      "distribution business. You buy your lightbulbs from the manufacturer and resell \n",
      "them at wholesale to small businesses and retail outlets. Unfortunately, you \n",
      "are only one of many competing distributors. As a result, you find that there is \n",
      "little room to negotiate with your customers. If you do not offer a competitive \n",
      "price-one that is determined in the marketplace-your customers will take \n",
      "their business elsewhere. In addition, you know that the number of lightbulbs \n",
      "that you sell will have little or no effect on the wholesale price of bulbs. You are \n",
      "a price taker. \n",
      "The assumption of price taking applies to consumers as well as firms. In a per­\n",
      "fectly competitive market, each consumer buys such a small proportion of total \n",
      "industry output that he or she has no impact on the market price, and therefore \n",
      "takes the price as given. \n",
      "Another way of stating the price-taking assumption is that there are many \n",
      "independent firms and independent consumers in the market, all of whom \n",
      "believe-correctly-that their decisions will not affect prices. \n",
      "PRODUCT HOMOGENEITY Price-taking behavior typically occurs in markets \n",
      "where firms produce identical, or nearly identical, products. When the products \n",
      "of all of the firms in a market are perfectly substitutable with one another-that is, \n",
      "when they are homogeneous-no firm can raise the price of its product above the \n",
      "price of other firms without losing most or all of its business. Most agricultural \n",
      "products are homogeneous: Because product quality is relatively similar among \n",
      "farms in a given region, for example, buyers of com do not ask which indi­\n",
      "vidual farm grew the product. Oil, gasoline, and raw materials such as copper, \n",
      "iron, lumber, cotton, and sheet steel are also fairly homogeneous. Economists \n",
      "refer to such homogeneous products as commodities. \n",
      "In contrast, when products are heterogeneous, each firm has the opportu­\n",
      "nity to raise its price above that of its competitors without losing all of its sales. \n",
      "Premium ice creams such as Hiiagen-Dazs, for example, can be sold at higher \n",

      "consumers to be a higher-quality product. \n",
      "The assumption of product homogeneity is important because it ensures that \n",
      "there is a single market price, consistent with supply-demand analysis. \n",
      "FREE ENTRY AND EXIT This third assumption, free entry (or exit), means that \n",

      "The special costs that could restrict entry are costs which an entrant to a \n",
      "market would have to bear, but which a firm that is already producing would \n",
      "not. The pharmaceutical industry, for example, is not perfectly competitive be­\n",
      "cause Merck, Pfizer, and other firms hold patents that give them unique rights \n",
      "to produce drugs. Any new entrant would either have to invest in research and \n",
      "development to obtain its own competing drugs or pay substantial license fees \n",
      "to one or more firms already in the market. R&D expenditures or license fees \n",
      "could limit a firm's ability to enter the market. Likewise, the aircraft industry \n",
      "is not perfectly competitive because entry requires an immense investment in \n",
      "plant and equipment that has little or no resale value. \n",
      "The assumption of free entry and exit is important for competition to be \n",
      "effective. It means that consumers can easily switch to a rival firm if a current \n",
      "supplier raises its price. For businesses, it means that a firm can freely enter \n",
      "an industry if it sees a profit opportunity and exit if it is losing money. Thus \n",
      "a firm can hire labor and purchase capital and raw materials as needed, and \n",
      "it can release or move these factors of production if it wants to shut down or \n",
      "relocate. \n",
      "If these three assumptions of perfect competition hold, market demand and \n",

      "The assumption of profit maximization is frequently used in microeconomics \n",

      "from profit-maximizing behavior. \n",
      "Managers may be more concerned with such goals as revenue maximiza­\n",
      "tion, revenue growth, or the payment of dividends to satisfy shareholders. They \n",
      "might also be overly concerned with the firm's short-run profit (perhaps to earn \n",
      "a promotion or a large bonus) at the expense of its longer-run profit, even though \n",
      "long-run profit maximization better serves the interests of the stockholders.1 \n",
      "Because technical and marketing information is costly to obtain, managers may \n",

      "On some occasions they may engage in acquisition and/ or growth strategies \n",
      "that are substantially more risky than the owners of the firm might wish. \n",
      "The recent rise in the number of corporate bankruptcies, especially those in \n",
      "the financial sector, along with the rapid increase in CEO salaries, has raised \n",

      "important questions, which we will address in Chapter 17, when we discuss the \n",
      "incentives of managers and owners in detail. For now, it is important to realize \n",
      "that a manager's freedom to pursue goals other than long-run profit maximiza­\n",

      "even though profit is zero. \n",

      "if the government were once again to regulate the wholesale price of natural \n",

      "SUMMARY \n",
      "1. Simple models of supply and demand can be used to \n",
      "analyze a wide variety of government policies, includ­\n",
      "ing price controls, minimum prices, price support \n",
      "programs, production quotas or incentive programs to \n",
      "limit output, import tariffs and quotas, and taxes and \n",
      "subsidies . \n",
      "2. In each case, consumer and producer surplus are used \n",
      "to evaluate the gains and losses to consumers and \n",
      "producers . Applying the methodology to natural gas \n",
      "price controls, airline regulation, price supports for \n",
      "wheat, and the sugar quota shows that these gains and \n",
      "losses can be quite large. \n",
      "3. When government imposes a tax or subsidy, price \n",
      "usually does not rise or fall by the full amount of the \n",
      "tax or subsidy. Also, the incidence of a tax or subsidy \n",
      "is usually split between producers and consumers . \n",
      "The fraction that each group ends up paying or receiv­\n",
      "ing depends on the relative elasticities of supply and \n",
      "demand. \n",
      "QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW \n",
      "1. What is meant by deadweight loss? Why does a price \n",
      "ceiling usually result in a deadweight loss? \n",
      "2. Suppose the supply curve for a good is completely \n",
      "inelastic. If the government imposed a price ceiling \n",
      "below the market-clearing level, would a deadweight \n",
      "loss result? Explain. 4. Government intervention generally leads to a dead­\n",
      "weight loss; even if consumer surplus and producer \n",
      "surplus are weighted equally, there will be a net loss \n",
      "from government policies that shifts surplus from one \n",
      "group to the other. In some cases, this deadweight loss \n",
      "will be small, but in other cases-price supports and \n",
      "import quotas are examples-it is large. This dead­\n",
      "weight loss is a form of economic inefficiency that \n",
      "must be taken into account when policies are designed \n",
      "and implemented . \n",
      "5. Government intervention in a competitive market \n",
      "is not always bad. Government-and the society it \n",

      "A Rule of Thumb for Pricing \n",
      "We know that price and output should be chosen so that marginal revenue \n",
      "equals marginal cost, but how can the manager of a firm find the correct \n",
      "price and output level in practice? Most managers have only limited know­\n",
      "ledge of the average and marginal revenue curves that their firms face. \n",
      "Similarly, they might know the firm's marginal cost only over a limited \n",
      "output range. We therefore want to translate the condition that marginal \n",
      "revenue should equal marginal cost into a rule of thumb that can be more \n",
      "easily applied in practice. \n",
      "To do this, we first write the expression for marginal revenue: \n",
      "6.R 6.(PQ) \n",
      "MR = 6. Q = ~ \n",
      "Note that the extra revenue from an incremental unit of quantity, 6.(PQ)/ 6.Q, \n",
      "has two components: \n",
      "1. Producing one extra unit and selling it at price P brings in revenue \n",
      "(l)(P) = P. \n",
      "2. But because the firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve, produc­\n",
      "ing and selling this extra unit also results in a small drop in price 6.P / 6.Q \n",
      "which reduces the revenue from all units sold (i.e., a change in revenue \n",
      "Q[6.P I 6.Q]). \n",
      "Thus, \n",
      "MR = P + Q :~ = P + P( ~ ) ( :~ ) \n",
      "We obtained the expression on the right by taking the term Q(6.P / 6.Q) \n",
      "and multiplying and dividing it by P. Recall that the elasticity of demand is \n",
      "defined as Ed = (P /Q)(6.Q/ 6.P). Thus (Q/P) (6.P / 6.Q) is the reciprocal of the \n",
      "elasticity of demand, 1/Ed, measured at the profit-maximizing output, and \n",
      "MR= P + P(l/Ed) \n",
      "Now, because the firm's objective is to maximize profit, we can set marginal \n",

      "shows, the less elastic its demand curve, the more monopoly power a firm has. The \n",

      "demand. Thus we should rephrase our question: Why do some firms (e.g., a su­\n",
      "permarket chain) face demand curves that are more elastic than those faced by \n",
      "others (e.g., a producer of designer clothing)? \n",
      "Three factors determine a firm's elasticity of demand. \n",
      "1. The elasticity of market demand. Because the firm's own demand will be \n",
      "at least as elastic as market demand, the elasticity of market demand lim­\n",
      "its the potential for monopoly power. \n",
      "2. The number of firms in the market. If there are many firms, it is unlikely \n",

      "barrier to entry Condition \n",
      "that impedes entry by new \n",
      "competitors. 3. The interaction among firms. Even if only two or three firms are in the \n",
      "market, each firm will be unable to profitably raise price very much if \n",
      "the rivalry among them is aggressive, with each firm trying to capture as \n",
      "much of the market as it can. \n",
      "Let's examine each of these three determinants of monopoly power. \n",
      "The Elasticity of Market Demand \n",
      "If there is only one firm-a pure monopolist-its demand curve is the market \n",
      "demand curve. In this case, the firm's degree of monopoly power depends \n",
      "completely on the elasticity of market demand. More often, however, several \n",
      "firms compete with one another; then the elasticity of market demand sets a \n",
      "lower limit on the magnitude of the elasticity of demand for each firm. Recall \n",
      "our example of the toothbrush producers illustrated in Figure 10.7 (page 360). \n",
      "The market demand for toothbrushes might not be very elastic, but each firm's \n",
      "demand will be more elastic. (In Figure 10.7, the elasticity of market demand \n",
      "is -1.5, and the elasticity of demand for each firm is -6.) A particular firm's \n",
      "elasticity depends on how the firms compete with one another. But no matter \n",
      "how they compete, the elasticity of demand for each firm could never become \n",
      "smaller in magnitude than -1.5. \n",
      "Because the demand for oil is fairly inelastic (at least in the short run), OPEC \n",
      "could raise oil prices far above marginal production cost during the 1970s and \n",
      "early 1980s. Because the demands for such commodities as coffee, cocoa, tin, \n",
      "and copper are much more elastic, attempts by producers to cartelize these mar­\n",
      "kets and raise prices have largely failed. In each case, the elasticity of market \n",
      "demand limits the potential monopoly power of individual producers. \n",
      "The Number of Firms \n",
      "The second determinant of a firm's demand curve-and thus of its monopoly \n",
      "power-is the number of firms in its market. Other things being equal, the mo­\n",
      "nopoly power of each firm will fall as the number of firms increases: As more \n",
      "and more firms compete, each firm will find it harder to raise prices and avoid \n",
      "losing sales to other firms. \n",
      "What matters, of course, is not just the total number of firms, but the number \n",
      "of \"major players\" -firms with significant market share. For example, if only \n",
      "two large firms account for 90 percent of sales in a market, with another 20 firms \n",
      "accounting for the remaining 10 percent, the two large firms might have consid­\n",
      "erable monopoly power. When only a few firms account for most of the sales in a \n",

      "It is sometimes said (not always jokingly) that the greatest fear of American \n",
      "business is competition. That may or may not be true. But we would certainly \n",
      "expect that when only a few firms are in a market, their managers will prefer \n",
      "that no new firms enter. An increase in the number of firms can only reduce \n",
      "the monopoly power of each incumbent firm. An important aspect of com­\n",

      "times the most important-determinant of monopoly power. Suppose there \n",
      "are four firms in a market. They might compete aggressively, undercutting \n",
      "one another's prices to capture more market share. This could drive prices \n",
      "down to nearly competitive levels. Each firm will fear that if it raises its \n",
      "price it will be undercut and lose market share. As a result, it will have little \n",
      "monopoly power. \n",
      "On the other hand, the firms might not compete much. They might even \n",
      "collude (in violation of the antitrust laws), agreeing to limit output and raise \n",
      "prices. Because raising prices in concert rather than individually is more likely \n",
      "to be profitable, collusion can generate substantial monopoly power. \n",
      "We will discuss the interaction among firms in detail in Chapters 12 and 13. \n",
      "Now we simply want to point out that, other things being equal, monopoly power \n",
      "is smaller when firms compete aggressively and is larger when they cooperate. \n",
      "Remember that a firm's monopoly power often changes over time, as its \n",
      "operating conditions (market demand and cost), its behavior, and the behavior \n",
      "of its competitors change. Monopoly power must therefore be thought of in a \n",
      "dynamic context. For example, the market demand curve might be very inelas­\n",
      "tic in the short run but much more elastic in the long run. (Because this is the \n",
      "case with oil, the OPEC cartel enjoyed considerable short-run but much less \n",

      "in the short run can make an industry more competitive in the long run: Large \n",

      "10.4 The Social Costs of Monopoly Power \n",
      "In a competitive market, price equals marginal cost. Monopoly power, on \n",

      "Bundling in Practice \n",
      "Bundling is a widely used pricing strategy. When you buy a new car, for ex­\n",
      "ample, you can purchase such options as power windows, power seats, or a \n",
      "sunroof separately, or you can purchase a \"luxury package\" in which these \n",
      "options are bundled. Manufacturers of luxury cars (such as Lexus, BMW, \n",
      "or Infiniti) tend to include such \"options\" as standard equipment; this \n",
      "practice is pure bundling. For more moderately priced cars, however, these \n",
      "items are optional, but are usually offered as part of a bundle. Automobile \n",
      "companies must decide which items to include in such bundles and how to \n",
      "price them. \n",
      "Another example is vacation travel. If you plan a vacation to Europe, you \n",
      "might make your own hotel reservations, buy an airplane ticket, and order a \n",
      "rental car. Alternatively, you might buy a vacation package in which airfare, \n",
      "land arrangements, hotels, and even meals are all bundled together. \n",
      "Still another example is cable television. Cable operators typically offer a \n",
      "basic service for a low monthly fee, plus individual \"premium\" channels, such \n",
      "as Cinemax, Home Box Office, and the Disney Channel, on an individual basis \n",
      "for additional monthly fees. However, they also offer packages in which two or \n",
      "more premium channels are sold as a bundle. Bundling cable channels is profit­\n",
      "able because demands are negatively correlated. How do we know that? Given \n",
      "that there are only 24 hours in a day, the time that a consumer spends watching \n",
      "HBO is time that cannot be spent watching the Disney Channel. Thus consumers \n",
      "with high reservation prices for some channels will have relatively low reserva­\n",
      "tion prices for others. \n",
      "How can a company decide whether to bundle its products, and determine \n",
      "the profit-maximizing prices? Most companies do not know their customers' \n",

      "Most customers go out to eat knowing \n",
      "roughly how much they are willing to \n",
      "spend for dinner (and choose the res­\n",

      "have different preferences. For exam­\n",

      "could happily skip dessert. Others attach little value to \n",
      "the appetizer but regard dessert as essential. And some \n",
      "customers attach moderate values to both appetizers \n",
      "and desserts. What pricing strategy lets the restaurant \n",
      "capture as much consumer surplus as possible from \n",
      "these heterogeneous customers? The answer, of course, \n",
      "is mixed bundling. \n",
      "For a restaurant, mixed bundling means offering \n",
      "both complete dinners (the appetizer, main course, \n",
      "and dessert come as a package) and an a la carte \n",
      "menu (the customer buys the appetizer, main course, \n",

      "more highly than others. (Such customers would \n",

      "Tying \n",
      "Tying is a general term that refers to any requirement that products be bought \n",
      "or sold in some combination. Pure bundling is a common form of tying, but \n",
      "tying can also take other forms. For example, suppose a firm sells a product \n",
      "(such as a copying machine) that requires the consumption of a secondary \n",
      "product (such as paper). The consumer who buys the first product is also \n",
      "required to buy the secondary product from the same company. This require­\n",
      "ment is usually imposed through a contract. Note that this is different from the \n",
      "examples of bundling discussed earlier. In those examples, the consumer might \n",
      "have been happy to buy just one of the products. In this case, however, the first \n",
      "product is useless without access to the secondary product. \n",
      "Why might firms use this kind of pricing practice? One of the main benefits of \n",
      "tying is that it often allows a firm to meter demand and thereby practice price dis­\n",
      "crimination more effectively. During the 1950s, for example, when Xerox had a mo­\n",
      "nopoly on copying machines but not on paper, customers who leased Xerox copiers \n",
      "also had to buy Xerox paper. This allowed Xerox to meter consumption (customers \n",
      "who used a machine intensively bought more paper), and thereby apply a two-part \n",
      "tariff to the pricing of its machines. Also during the 1950s, IBM required custom­\n",
      "ers who leased its mainframe computers to use paper computer cards made only \n",
      "by IBM. By pricing cards well above marginal cost, IBM was effectively charging \n",
      "higher prices for computer usage to customers with larger demands.18 \n",
      "Tying can also be used to extend a firm's market power. As we discussed \n",
      "in Example 10.8 (page 384), in 1998 the Department of Justice brought suit \n",

      "purchase inputs from the franchiser. For example, Mobil Oil requires its service \n",

      "SUMMARY \n",
      "1. Firms with market power are in an enviable position \n",
      "because they have the potential to earn large profits. \n",
      "Realizing that potential, however, may depend criti­\n",
      "cally on pricing strategy. Even if the firm sets a single \n",
      "price, it needs an estimate of the elasticity of demand \n",
      "for its output. More complicated strategies, which can \n",
      "involve setting several different prices, require even \n",
      "more information about demand. \n",
      "2. A pricing strategy aims to enlarge the customer base that \n",
      "the firm can sell to and capture as much consumer sur­\n",
      "plus as possible. There are a number of ways to do this, \n",
      "and they usually involve setting more than a single price. \n",
      "3. Ideally, the firm would like to price discriminate \n",
      "perfectly-i.e ., to charge each customer his or her reserva­\n",

      "The Vertically Integrated Firm \n",
      "Many firms are integrated-they consist of several divisions, each with its own \n",
      "managers. Some firms are horizontally integrated: There are several divisions \n",
      "that produce the same or closely related products. We saw an example of this \n",
      "when we discussed the multi-plant firm in Section 10.1. Some firms are verti­\n",
      "cally integrated: They have several divisions, with some divisions producing \n",
      "parts and components which other divisions use to produce the finished prod­\n",
      "uct. For example, automobile companies have \"upstream\" divisions that pro­\n",
      "duce engines, brakes, radiators and other components that the \"downstream\" \n",
      "divisions use to produce the finished cars. (Some firms are both vertically and \n",
      "horizontally integrated.) \n",
      "This appendix explains the economic issues that arise in a vertically inte­\n",
      "grated firm. As we will see, vertical integration has important benefits, but it \n",
      "also introduces complex pricing decisions: How should the firm value the parts \n",
      "and components that are transferred from the upstream to the downstream di­\n",
      "visions? The firm must determine transfer prices, the internal prices at which \n",
      "the parts and components from upstream divisions are \"sold\" to downstream \n",
      "divisions. Transfer prices must be chosen correctly because they are the signals \n",
      "that divisional managers use to determine output levels. \n",
      "We will begin by explaining the advantages of vertical integration-advan­\n",
      "tages to the firm, as well as to the consumers who buy the end products of the \n",
      "firm. Some firms, however, are not vertically integrated; they simply buy parts \n",
      "and components from other independent firms. To understand why, we will \n",
      "explain some of the problems associated with vertical integration. Next, we \n",
      "will explain transfer pricing, and show how a vertically integrated firm should \n",
      "choose its transfer prices in a way that maximizes the firm's total profit. \n",
      "Why Vertically Integrate? \n",
      "There are a number of advantages to vertical integration. If upstream and \n",
      "downstream divisions are part of the same firm, it might be easier to guarantee \n",
      "that parts and components are produced and delivered on time, and are made \n",
      "to the precise specifications needed by the downstream division. (On the other \n",
      "hand, a carefully written and enforced contract between independent upstream \n",
      "and downstream firms can often achieve the same thing.) The biggest advan­\n",
      "tage of vertical integration, however, is that it avoids the problem of \"double \n",

      "Market Power and Double Marginalization \n",

      "To answer these questions, consider the following example. Suppose an \n",
      "engine manufacturer has monopoly power in the market for engines, and an \n",

      "Thus, taking taxes into account, the firm will want to set a higher transfer price, \n",

      "other, each firm has at least some monopoly power: It has control over \n",
      "price and can profitably charge a price that exceeds marginal cost. \n",
      "In this chapter, we examine market structures other than pure mo­\n",

      "seem like an oxymoron: monopolistic competition . A monopolistically \n",
      "competitive market is similar to a perfectly competitive market in two \n",
      "key respects: There are many firms, and entry by new firms is not re­\n",
      "stricted. But it differs from perfect competition in that the product is \n",
      "differentiated: Each firm sells a brand or version of the product that differs \n",
      "in quality, appearance, or reputation, and each firm is the sole producer \n",
      "of its own brand. The amount of monopoly power wielded by a firm \n",
      "depends on its success in differentiating its product from those of other \n",
      "firms. Examples of monopolistically competitive industries abound: \n",
      "Toothpaste, laundry detergent, and packaged coffee are a few. \n",
      "The second form of market structure we will examine is oligopoly: \n",
      "a market in which only a few firms compete with one another, and \n",
      "entry by new firms is impeded. The product that the firms produce \n",
      "might be differentiated, as with automobiles, or it might not be, as \n",

      "In some oligopolistic industries, firms do cooperate, but in others, \n",

      "see why, we need to consider how oligopolistic firms decide on out­\n",

      "many cartels tend to be unstable and short-lived. \n",
      "12.1 Monopolistic Competition \n",
      "In many industries, the products are differentiated. For one reason or another, \n",
      "consumers view each firm's brand as different from other brands. Crest tooth­\n",

      "tion-the consumer's image (correct or incorrect) of the relative decay-preventing \n",
      "efficacy of Crest. As a result, some consumers (but not all) will pay more for Crest. \n",
      "Because Procter & Gamble is the sole producer of Crest, it has monopoly \n",
      "power. But its monopoly power is limited because consumers can easily sub­\n",
      "stitute other brands if the price of Crest rises. Although consumers who prefer \n",
      "Crest will pay more for it, most of them will not pay much more. The typical \n",
      "Crest user might pay 25 or 50 cents a tube more, but probably not one or two \n",
      "dollars more. For most consumers, toothpaste is toothpaste, and the differences \n",
      "among brands are small. Therefore, the demand curve for Crest toothpaste, \n",
      "though downward sloping, is fairly elastic. (A reasonable estimate of the elastic­\n",
      "ity of demand for Crest is -5.) Because of its limited monopoly power, Procter \n",
      "& Gamble will charge a price that is higher, but not much higher, than marginal \n",
      "cost. The situation is similar for Tide detergent or Scott paper towels. \n",
      "The Makings of Monopolistic Competition \n",
      "A monopolistically competitive market has two key characteristics: \n",
      "1. Firms compete by selling differentiated products that are highly substitut­\n",
      "able for one another but not perfect substitutes. In other words, the cross­\n",
      "price elasticities of demand are large but not infinite. \n",
      "2. There is free entry and exit: It is relatively easy for new firms to enter the \n",
      "market with their own brands and for existing firms to leave if their prod­\n",
      "ucts become unprofitable. \n",
      "To see why free entry is an important requirement, let's compare the \n",
      "markets for toothpaste and automobiles. The toothpaste market is monopo­\n",
      "listically competitive, but the automobile market is better characterized as \n",
      "an oligopoly. It is relatively easy for other firms to introduce new brands of \n",
      "toothpaste, and this limits the profitability of producing Crest or Colgate. If \n",
      "the profits were large, other firms would spend the necessary money (for de­\n",
      "velopment, production, advertising, and promotion) to introduce new brands \n",
      "of their own, which would reduce the market shares and profitability of Crest \n",
      "and Colgate. \n",
      "The automobile market is also characterized by product differentiation. \n",
      "However, the large-scale economies involved in production make entry by new \n",
      "firms difficult. Thus, until the mid-1970s, when Japanese producers became \n",
      "CHAPTER 12 MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION AND OLIGOPOLY 445 \n",
      "important competitors, the three major U.S. automakers had the market largely \n",
      "to themselves. \n",
      "There are many other examples of monopolistic competition besides tooth­\n",
      "paste. Soap, shampoo, deodorants, shaving cream, cold remedies, and many \n",
      "other items found in a drugstore are sold in monopolistically competitive \n",
      "markets. The markets for many sporting goods are likewise monopolistically \n",
      "competitive. So is most retail trade, because goods are sold in many different \n",
      "stores that compete with one another by differentiating their services according \n",
      "to location, availability and expertise of salespeople, credit terms, etc. Entry is \n",
      "relatively easy, so if profits are high in a neighborhood because there are only a \n",

      "Equilibrium in the Short Run and the Long Run \n",
      "As with monopoly, in monopolistic competition firms face downward-sloping \n",
      "demand curves. Therefore, they have some monopoly power. But this does not \n",

      "cordingly. This allows firms to develop reputations from which trust can arise. \n",
      "As a result, oligopolistic coordination and cooperation can sometimes prevail. \n",
      "Take, for example, an industry made up of three or four firms that have \n",
      "coexisted for a long time. Over the years, the managers of those firms might \n",
      "grow tired of losing money because of price wars, and an implicit understand­\n",
      "ing might arise by which all the firms maintain high prices and no firm tries to \n",
      "take market share from its competitors. Although each firm might be tempted \n",
      "to undercut its competitors, its managers know that the resulting gains will be \n",
      "short lived: Competitors will retaliate, and the result will be renewed warfare \n",
      "and lower profits over the long run. \n",
      "This resolution of the prisoners' dilemma occurs in some industries, but not \n",
      "in others. Sometimes managers are not content with the moderately high profits \n",
      "resulting from implicit collusion and prefer to compete aggressively in order to \n",
      "increase market share. Sometimes implicit understandings are difficult to reach. \n",
      "For example, firms with different costs and different assessments of market \n",

      "the \"correct\" price is $10, while Firm B thinks it is $9. When it sets a $9 price, \n",
      "Firm A might view this as an attempt to undercut and retaliate by lowering its \n",

      "of oligopolistic industries. Even if costs or demand change, firms are reluctant \n",
      "to change price. If costs fall or market demand declines, they fear that lower \n",
      "prices might send the wrong message to their competitors and set off a price \n",
      "war. And if costs or demand rises, they are reluctant to raise prices because they \n",
      "are afraid that their competitors may not raise theirs. \n",
      "Price rigidity is the basis of the kinked demand curve model of oligopoly. \n",
      "According to this model, each firm faces a demand curve kinked at the cur­\n",
      "rently prevailing price P*. (See Figure 12.7.) At prices above P*, the demand \n",
      "curve is very elastic. The reason is that the firm believes that if it raises its price \n",
      "above P*, other firms will not follow suit, and it will therefore lose sales and \n",
      "much of its market share. On the other hand, the firm believes that if it lowers \n",

      "their shares of the market. In that case, sales will expand only to the extent that a \n",

      "Because the firm's demand curve is kinked, its marginal revenue curve is \n",

      "It is useful mainly as a description of price rigidity rather than as an explanation \n",

      "Sometimes a pattern is established whereby one firm regularly announces \n",

      "price leadership: One firm is implicitly recognized as the \"leader,\" while the \n",

      "SUMMARY \n",
      "1. In a monopolistically competitive market, firms com­\n",
      "pete by selling differentiated products, which are \n",
      "highly substitutable . New firms can enter or exit eas­\n",
      "ily. Firms have only a small amount of monopoly \n",
      "power. In the long run, entry will occur until profits \n",
      "are driven to zero. Firms then produce with excess ca­\n",
      "pacity (i.e., at output levels below those that minimize \n",
      "average cost). \n",
      "2. In an oligopolistic market, only a few firms account \n",
      "for most or all of production . Barriers to entry allow \n",
      "some firms to earn substantial profits, even over \n",
      "the long run. Economic decisions involve strategic \n",
      "considerations-each firm must consider how its \n",
      "actions will affect its rivals, and how they are likely \n",
      "to react. \n",
      "3. In the Cournot model of oligopoly, firms make their \n",
      "output decisions at the same time, each taking the oth­\n",
      "er's output as fixed. In equilibrium, each firm is maxi­\n",
      "mizing its profit, given the output of its competitor, \n",
      "so no firm has an incentive to change its output. The \n",
      "firms are therefore in a Nash equilibrium . Each firm's \n",
      "profit is higher than it would be under perfect compe­\n",
      "tition but less than what it would earn by colluding . \n",
      "4. In the Stackelberg model, one firm sets its output first. \n",
      "That firm has a strategic advantage and earns a higher \n",
      "profit. It knows that it can choose a large output and It remains to be seen whether the variety of \n",
      "auto parts agreements that have been unearthed \n",
      "are best described as a single cartel or a col­\n",
      "lection of interrelated cartels, with agreements \n",
      "varying from auto part to auto part. What is clear \n",
      "is that the successful operation of the cartel or \n",
      "cartels was aided by regular communications (in­\n",
      "person meetings and telephone calls) in which \n",
      "agreements were reached not only with respect to \n",
      "price but also on ways of monitoring the actions \n",
      "of the cartel members and finding ways to pun­\n",

      "The extent to which the auto parts cartel has \n",

      "markets in which firms produce substitute goods and \n",
      "compete by setting price. In equilibrium, each firm \n",
      "maximizes its profit, given the prices of its competi­\n",

      "6. Firms would earn higher profits by collusively agree­\n",

      "a Nash equilibrium and saw that it is widely applicable and intuitively appealing.5 \n",
      "Recall that a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies (or actions) such that each \n",

      "the example shown in Table 13.2, the Nash equilibrium is that both firms adver­\n",
      "tise: Given the decision of its competitor, each firm is satisfied that it has made \n",
      "the best decision possible, and so has no incentive to change its decision. \n",
      "In Chapter 12, we used the Nash equilibrium to study output and pricing by \n",
      "oligopolistic firms. In the Coumot model, for example, each firm sets its own \n",
      "output while taking the outputs of its competitors as fixed. We saw that in a \n",
      "Cournot equilibrium, no firm has an incentive to change its output unilaterally \n",
      "because each firm is doing the best it can given the decisions of its competitors. \n",
      "Thus a Coumot equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium.6 We also examined models \n",

      "Second, my competitor might have some doubt about the extent of my \n",

      "sure that I am playing tit-for-tat \"blindly,\" or even that I am playing tit-for-tat \n",
      "at all. Just the possibility can make cooperative behavior a good strategy (until \n",
      "near the end) if the time horizon is long enough. Although my competitor's \n",

      "If Firm X does enter the market, you must make a decision. You can be \"ac­\n",

      "shown in the upper left-hand comer of the payoff matrix.) Alternatively, you \n",
      "can increase your production capacity, produce more, and lower your price. The \n",

      "cannot be expected to maintain output at their pre-entry levels. Eventually, they \n",
      "may back off and reduce output, raising price to a new joint profit-maximizing \n",
      "level. Because potential entrants know this, incumbent firms must create a cred­\n",
      "ible threat of warfare to deter entry. A reputation for irrationality can help. Indeed, \n",

      "1. In private-value auctions each bidder knows his or her individual valua­\n",
      "tion or reservation price, and valuations differ from bidder to bidder. In ad­\n",
      "dition, each bidder is uncertain about the value that other bidders place on \n",
      "the product. For example, I might value a signed Barry Bonds home run \n",
      "baseball very highly but not know that you value it less highly. \n",
      "2. In common-value auctions, the item to be auctioned has approximately \n",
      "the same value to all bidders. Bidders, however, do not know precisely \n",
      "what that value is-they can only estimate it, and bidders' estimates will \n",
      "vary. For example, in an auction of an offshore oil reserve, the value of \n",
      "the reserve is the price of oil minus the extraction cost, times the amount \n",
      "of oil in the reserve. As a result, the value should be about the same for \n",
      "all bidders. However, bidders will not know the amount of oil or the \n",
      "extraction cost-they can only estimate these numbers. Because their \n",
      "estimates will differ, they might bid very different amounts to get the \n",
      "reserve. \n",
      "In reality, auctions can have both private-value and common-value ele­\n",
      "ments. In the oil reserve auction, for example, there may be some private­\n",
      "value elements because different oil reserves may entail different extraction \n",

      "Private-Value Auctions \n",
      "In private-value auctions, bidders have different reservation prices for the of­\n",
      "fered item. We might suppose, for example, that in an auction for a signed Barry \n",
      "Bonds baseball, individuals' reservation prices range from $1 (someone who \n",
      "doesn't like baseball but is bidding just for fun) to $600 (a San Francisco Giants \n",
      "fan). Of course, if you are bidding for the baseball, you don't know how many \n",
      "people will bid against you or what their bids will be. \n",
      "Whatever the auction format, each bidder must choose his or her bidding \n",

      "vidual expects to make his or her only bid. For a sealed-bid auction, the strategy \n",
      "is the choice of bid to place in a sealed envelope. \n",
      "What are the payoffs in this bidding game? The payoff for winning is the dif­\n",
      "ference between the winner's reservation price and the price paid; the payoff \n",
      "for losing is zero. Given these payoffs, let's examine bidding strategies and out­\n",
      "comes for different auction formats. \n",
      "We will begin by showing that English oral auctions and second-price \n",
      "sealed-bid auctions generate nearly identical outcomes. Let's begin with the \n",
      "second-price sealed-bid auction. In this auction, bidding truthfully is a dominant \n",
      "strategy-there is no advantage to bidding below your reservation price. Why? \n",
      "Because the price you pay is based on the valuation of the second highest bidder, \n",
      "not on your own valuation. Suppose that your reservation price is $100. If you \n",
      "bid below your reservation price-say, $80-you risk losing to the second­\n",
      "highest bidder, who bids $85, when winning (at, say, $87) would have given \n",
      "you a positive payoff. If you bid above your reservation price-say $105-you \n",
      "risk winning but receiving a negative payoff. \n",
      "CHAPTER 13 GAME THEORY AND COMPETITIVE STRATEGY 511 \n",
      "Similarly, in an English auction the dominant strategy is to continue bidding \n",
      "until the second person is unwilling to make a bid. Then the winning bid will \n",
      "be approximately equal to the reservation price of the second person. In any \n",
      "case, you should stop bidding when the bidding reaches your reservation price. \n",
      "Why? Because if you stop bidding at a point below your reservation price, you \n",
      "risk losing a positive payoff; if you continue beyond your reservation price, \n",
      "you will be guaranteed a negative payoff. How high will the bidding go? It \n",
      "will continue until the winning bid is approximately equal to the reserva­\n",
      "tion price of the second-highest bidder. Likewise, in the sealed-bid auction \n",
      "the winning bid will equal the reservation price of the second-highest bidder. \n",
      "Thus, both auction formats generate nearly identical outcomes. (The outcomes \n",
      "should differ in theory only by a dollar or two.) To illustrate, suppose that \n",
      "there are three bidders whose valuations are $50, $40, and $30, respectively, \n",
      "and furthermore the auctioneer and the bidders have complete information \n",
      "about these valuations. In an English auction, if your valuation was $50 you \n",
      "would offer a winning bid of $40.01 in order to win the bidding from the indi­\n",
      "vidual whose reservation price was $40.00. You would make the identical bid \n",
      "in a sealed-bid auction. \n",
      "Even in a world of incomplete information, we would expect similar results. \n",
      "Indeed, you know that as a seller, you should be indifferent between an oral \n",
      "English auction and a second-price sealed-bid auction, because bidders in each \n",
      "case have private values. Suppose that you plan to sell an item using a sealed­\n",
      "bid auction. Which should you choose, a first-price or a second-price auction? \n",
      "You might think that the first-price auction is better because the payment is \n",
      "given by the highest rather than the second-highest bid. Bidders, however, \n",
      "are aware of this reasoning and will alter their bidding strategies accord­\n",
      "ingly: They will bid less in anticipation of paying the winning bid if they are \n",
      "successful. \n",
      "The second-price sealed-bid auction generates revenue equal to the second­\n",
      "highest reservation price. However, the revenue implications of a first-price \n",

      "ning? No-you will have paid $6.80 for $6.20 worth of pennies. You will have \n",
      "fallen prey to the winner's curse: The winner of a common-value auction is \n",
      "often worse off than those who did not win because the winner was overly op­\n",
      "timistic and, as a consequence, bid more for the item than it was actually worth. \n",
      "The winner's curse can arise in any common-value auction, and bidders of­\n",
      "ten fail to take it into account. Suppose, for example, that your house needs to \n",
      "be painted. You ask five companies to give you cost estimates for the job, telling \n",
      "each that you will accept the lowest estimate. Who will win the job? It will prob­\n",
      "ably be the painter who has most seriously underestimated the amount of work \n",
      "involved. At first, that painter might be happy to have won the job, only later to \n",
      "realize that much more work is required than was anticipated. The same prob­\n",
      "lem can arise for oil companies bidding for offshore oil reserves when the size \n",
      "of the reserve and cost of extraction are uncertain (so that the value of the re­\n",
      "serve is uncertain). Unless the companies take the winner's curse into account, \n",
      "the winning bidder is likely to win by overestimating the value of the reserve \n",
      "and will thus pay more than the reserve is worth. \n",
      "How should you take the winner's curse into account when bidding for an item \n",
      "in a common-value auction? You must not only estimate the value of the item that \n",
      "you are bidding for, but also account for the fact that your estimate-and the esti­\n",
      "mates of the other bidders-are subject to error. To avoid the winner's curse, you \n",
      "must reduce your maximum bid below your value estimate by an amount equal to \n",

      "you need to reduce your bid. If you can't assess the precision of your estimate di­\n",

      "Now let's return to the question of auction design from the viewpoint of the \n",
      "seller. Here are some useful tips for choosing the best auction format. \n",
      "1. In a private-value auction, you should encourage as many bidders as pos­\n",
      "sible: Additional bidders increase the expected bid of the winner and the \n",
      "expected valuation of the second-highest bidder as well. \n",
      "2. In a common-value auction, you should (a) use an open rather than a \n",
      "sealed-bid auction because, as a general rule, an English (open) common­\n",
      "value auction will generate greater expected revenue than a sealed-bid \n",
      "auction; and (b) reveal information about the true value of the object being \n",
      "auctioned, thereby reducing concern about the winner's curse and, conse­\n",
      "quently, encouraging more bidding. \n",
      "3. In a private-value auction, set a minimum bid equal to or even somewhat \n",
      "higher than the value to you of keeping the good for future sale. This will \n",
      "protect against a loss if there are relatively few bidders who do not value \n",
      "the good very highly. Moreover, it could increase the size of the bids by \n",
      "signaling to buyers that the object is valuable. Having the opportunity to \n",
      "try again to sell the good if there is no minimum bid is obviously an ad­\n",
      "vantage; however, it can be a disadvantage if failure to sell the good the \n",
      "first time is seen as a signal of low quality to bidders in future auctions. \n",
      "Why use an open auction? Recall that in order to avoid the winner's curse, \n",
      "each bidder in a common value auction will bid below his individual valua­\n",
      "tion. The greater the uncertainty about the true value of the object, the greater \n",
      "the likelihood of an overbid, and therefore the greater the incentive for the \n",
      "bidder to reduce his bid. (If the bidder is risk-averse, this effect will be magni­\n",
      "fied.) However, the bidder faces less uncertainty in an English auction than in \n",
      "a sealed-bid auction because he can observe the prices at which other bidders \n",
      "drop out of the competition-an advantage that provides information about \n",
      "their valuations. In short, when you provide more information to bidders, risk­\n",
      "averse bidders will be encouraged to bid more because they will be more confi­\n",
      "dent that they can account for the possibility of a winner's curse. \n",
      "Bidding and Collusion \n",
      "We have seen that sellers at auctions can obtain a significant share of the gains \n",
      "from trade by encouraging competition among buyers. It follows, therefore, \n",
      "that buyers can increase their bargaining power by reducing the number of \n",
      "bidders or the frequency of bidding. In some cases this can be accomplished le­\n",
      "gally through the formation of buying groups, but it may also be accomplished \n",
      "illegally through collusive agreements that violate the antitrust laws. Collusion \n",
      "among buyers is not easy, because even if an \"agreement\" is reached, individual \n",
      "buyers will have an incentive to cheat by increasing their bids at the last min­\n",

      "participants to penalize those that break from the agreement by outbidding the \n",
      "\"cheater\" again and again. Buyer collusion is more of a problem in open-bid \n",
      "auctions than in the case of sealed bids because open auctions offer the best op­\n",

      "ter, we discuss factor markets: markets for labor, raw materials, \n",

      "same is true for factor markets. We will examine three different factor \n",

      "3. Markets in which sellers of factors have monopoly power. \n",
      "We will also point out instances in which equilibrium in the factor \n",
      "market depends on the extent of market power in output markets. \n",
      "14.1 Competitive Factor Markets \n",
      "A competitive factor market is one in which there are a large number of \n",
      "sellers and buyers of a factor of production, such as labor or raw ma­\n",
      "terials. Because no single seller or buyer can affect the price of a given \n",
      "factor, each is a price taker. For example, if individual firms that buy \n",
      "lumber to construct homes purchase a small share of the total volume \n",
      "of lumber available, their purchasing decision will have no effect on \n",
      "price. Likewise, if each supplier of lumber controls only a small share \n",
      "of the market, no individual supplier's decision will affect the price \n",
      "of the lumber that he sells. Instead, the price of lumber (and the total \n",
      "quantity produced) will be determined by the aggregate supply and \n",
      "demand for lumber. \n",
      "We begin by analyzing the demands for a factor by individual \n",
      "firms. These demands are added to get market demand. We then shift \n",

      "derived demands: They depend on, and are derived from, the firm's level \n",
      "of output and the costs of inputs. For example, the demand of the Microsoft \n",
      "Corporation for computer programmers is a derived demand that depends \n",
      "not only on the current salaries of programmers, but also on how much soft­\n",
      "ware Microsoft expects to sell. \n",
      "To analyze factor demands, we will use the material from Chapter 7 that \n",
      "shows how a firm chooses its production inputs. We will assume that the firm \n",
      "produces its output using two inputs, capital Kand labor L, that can be hired \n",
      "at the prices r (the rental cost of capital) and w (the wage rate), respectively.1 \n",
      "We will also assume that the firm has its plant and equipment in place (as in a \n",
      "short-run analysis) and must only decide how much labor to hire. \n",
      "Suppose that the firm has hired a certain number of workers and wants to know \n",
      "whether it is profitable to hire one additional worker. This will be profitable if the \n",
      "additional revenue from the output of the worker's labor is greater than its cost. \n",
      "The additional revenue from an incremental unit of labor, the marginal revenue \n",
      "product of labor, is denoted MRPL. The cost of an incremental unit of labor is the \n",
      "wage rate, w. Thus, it is profitable to hire more labor if the MRPL is at least as large \n",
      "as the wage rate w. \n",
      "How do we measure the MRPL? It's the additional output obtained from the ad­\n",
      "ditional unit of this labor, multiplied by the additional revenue from an extra unit of \n",
      "output. The additional output is given by the marginal product of labor MPL \n",
      "and the additional revenue by the marginal revenue MR. \n",
      "Formally, the marginal revenue product is /1R/ /1L, where L is the number of \n",
      "units of labor input and R is revenue. The additional output per unit of labor, \n",
      "the MPL, is given by /1Q/ /1L, and marginal revenue, MR, is equal to /1R//1Q. \n",
      "Because 11R/ 11L = (/1R)/(/1Q)(/1Q / /1L), it follows that \n",

      "This important result holds for any competitive factor market, whether or \n",
      "not the output market is competitive. However, to examine the characteristics of \n",
      "the MRPL, let's begin with the case of a perfectly competitive output (and input) \n",

      "ket price P. The marginal revenue from the sale of an additional unit of output \n",

      "SUMMARY \n",
      "1. In a competitive input market, the demand for an \n",

      "product of the firm's marginal revenue, and the mar­\n",
      "ginal product of the input. \n",
      "2. A firm in a competitive labor market will hire workers \n",
      "to the point at which the marginal revenue product \n",

      "marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. \n",
      "3. The market demand for an input is the horizontal \n",
      "sum of industry demands for the input. But industry \n",
      "demand is not the horizontal sum of the demands of \n",
      "all the firms in the industry. To determine industry \n",
      "demand, one must remember that the market price of \n",
      "the product will change in response to changes in the \n",

      "15 .1 Stocks versus Flows \n",
      "Before proceeding, we must be clear about how to measure capital and other \n",

      "tity of plant and equipment that the firm owns. For example, if a firm owns an \n",

      "as flows. The output of the firm is also a flow. For example, this same firm might \n",

      "DIVERSIFIABLE RISK To understand this, recall from Chapter 5 that diversify­\n",

      "Much the same is true about capital investment decisions. Although the \n",
      "profit flow from a single investment may be very risky, overall risk will be \n",
      "much less if the firm invests in dozens of projects (as most large firms do). \n",
      "Furthermore, even if the company invests in only one project, stockholders can \n",
      "easily diversify by holding the stocks of a dozen or more different companies, \n",
      "or by holding a mutual fund that invests in many stocks. Thus, stockholders­\n",
      "the owners of the firm-can eliminate diversifiable risk. \n",
      "Because investors can eliminate diversifiable risk, they cannot expect to earn \n",
      "a return higher than the risk-free rate by bearing it: No one will pay you for \n",
      "bearing a risk that there is no need to bear. And indeed, assets that have only di­\n",

      "remember that the discount rate for a project is the opportunity cost of investing \n",

      "NONDIVERSIFIABLE RISK What about nondiversifiable risk? First, let's be \n",

      "resulting from acts of war. \n",
      "13Diversifiable risk is also called nonsystematic risk and nondiversifiable risk is called systematic \n",
      "risk. Adding a simple risk premium to the discount rate may not always be the correct way of \n",
      "dealing with risk. See, for example, Richard Brealey and Stewart Myers, Principles of Corporate \n",

      "CHAPTER 15 INVESTMENT, TIME, AND CAPITAL MARKETS 567 \n",
      "For capital investments, nondiversifiable risk arises because a firm's profits \n",
      "tend to depend on the overall economy. When economic growth is strong, cor­\n",
      "porate profits tend to be higher. (For our electric motor factory, the demand for \n",

      "must be included in the discount rate. Let's see how the size of that risk pre­\n",
      "mium can be determined. \n",
      "The Capital Asset Pricing Model \n",
      "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) measures the risk premium for a \n",
      "capital investment by comparing the expected return on that investment with \n",
      "the expected return on the entire stock market. To understand the model, \n",
      "suppose, first, that you invest in the entire stock market (say, through a mu­\n",
      "tual fund). In that case, your investment would be completely diversified and \n",
      "you would bear no diversifiable risk. You would, however, bear nondiversifi­\n",
      "able risk because the stock market tends to move with the overall economy. \n",
      "(The stock market reflects expected future profits, which depend in part on \n",
      "the economy.) As a result, the expected return on the stock market is higher \n",
      "than the risk-free rate. Denoting the expected return on the stock market by \n",
      "rm and the risk-free rate by rf, the risk premium on the market is rm -r1. This \n",
      "is the additional expected return you get for bearing the nondiversifiable risk \n",
      "associated with the stock market. \n",
      "Now consider the nondiversifiable risk associated with one asset, such as a \n",
      "company's stock. We can measure that risk in terms of the extent to which the \n",
      "return on the asset tends to be correlated with (i.e., move in the same direction \n",
      "as) the return on the stock market as a whole. For example, one company's \n",
      "stock might have almost no correlation with the market as a whole. On average, \n",
      "the price of that stock would move independently of changes in the market, so \n",
      "it would have little or no nondiversifiable risk. The return on that stock should \n",
      "therefore be about the same as the risk-free rate. Another stock, however, might \n",
      "be highly correlated with the market. Its price changes might even amplify \n",
      "changes in the market as a whole. That stock would have substantial nondiver­\n",
      "sifiable risk, perhaps more than the stock market as a whole. If so, its return on \n",
      "average will exceed the market return rm· \n",
      "The CAPM summarizes this relationship between expected returns and the \n",
      "risk premium by the following equation: \n",

      "the risk premium on the market. The constant of proportionality, /3, is called the \n",
      "asset beta. It measures the sensitivity of the asset's return to market movements \n",
      "and, therefore, the asset's nondiversifiable risk. If a 1-percent rise in the market \n",
      "tends to result in a 2-percent rise in the asset price, the beta is 2. If a 1-percent rise \n",

      "shown that for any initial allocation of resources, a competitive process of \n",
      "exchange among individuals, whether through exchange, input markets, or \n",
      "output markets, will lead to a Pareto efficient outcome. The first theorem of \n",
      "welfare economics tells us that a competitive system, building on the self­\n",
      "interested goals of consumers and producers and on the ability of market \n",
      "prices to convey information to both parties, will achieve a Pareto efficient \n",
      "allocation of resources. \n",
      "Second, we have shown that with indifference curves that are convex, any \n",
      "efficient allocation of resources can be achieved by a competitive process with a \n",
      "suitable redistribution of those resources. Of course, there may be many Pareto \n",
      "efficient outcomes. But the second theorem of welfare economics tells us that \n",
      "under certain (admittedly ideal) conditions, issues of equity and efficiency can \n",
      "be treated distinctly from one another. If we are willing to put equity issues \n",
      "aside, then we know that there is a competitive equilibrium that maximizes \n",
      "consumer and producer surplus, i.e., is economically efficient. \n",
      "Both theorems of welfare economics depend crucially on the assumption that \n",

      "Market Power \n",
      "We have seen that inefficiency arises when a producer or supplier of a factor \n",

      "If consumers do not have accurate information about market prices or product \n",

      "with the problem of asymmetric information: market signaling. The concept \n",
      "of market signaling was first developed by Michael Spence, who showed that \n",
      "in some markets, sellers send buyers signals that convey information about a \n",
      "product's quality.4 \n",
      "To see how market signaling works, let's look at a labor market, which is a good \n",
      "example of a market with asymmetric information. Suppose a firm is thinking \n",
      "about hiring some new people. The new workers (the \"sellers\" of labor) know \n",
      "much more about the quality of the labor they can provide than does the firm (the \n",
      "buyer of labor). For example, they know how hard they tend to work, how respon­\n",
      "sible they are, what their skills are, and so forth. The firm will learn these things \n",
      "only after workers have been hired and have been working for some time. \n",
      "Why don't firms simply hire workers, see how well they work, and then fire \n",
      "those with low productivity? Because this policy is often very costly. In many \n",
      "countries, and in many firms in the United States, it is difficult to fire someone \n",
      "who has been working more than a few months. (The firm may have to show \n",
      "just cause or provide severance pay.) Moreover, in many jobs, workers do not \n",
      "become fully productive for at least six months. Before that time, considerable \n",
      "on-the-job training may be required, for which the firm must invest substantial \n",
      "resources. Thus the firm might not learn how good workers are for six months \n",
      "to a year. Clearly, firms would be much better off if they knew how productive \n",
      "potential employees were before they hired them. \n",
      "What characteristics can a firm examine to obtain information about people's \n",
      "productivity before it hires them? Can potential employees convey informa­\n",
      "tion about their productivity? Dressing well for the job interview might convey \n",
      "some information, but even unproductive people can dress well. Dressing well \n",
      "is thus a weak signal-it doesn't do much to distinguish high-productivity from \n",
      "low-productivity people. To be strong, a signal must be easier for high-productivity \n",
      "people to give than for low-productivity people to give, so that high-productivity people \n",
      "are more likely to give it. \n",
      "For example, education is a strong signal in labor markets. A person's educa­\n",
      "tional level can be measured by several things-the number of years of school­\n",
      "ing, degrees obtained, the reputation of the university or college that granted \n",
      "the degrees, the person's grade-point average, and so on. Of course, education \n",
      "can directly and indirectly improve a person's productivity by providing in­\n",

      "education did not improve productivity, it would still be a useful signal of pro­\n",

      "To understand how signaling works, we will discuss a simple model.5 Let's as­\n",
      "sume that there are only low-productivity workers (Group I), whose average \n",
      "and marginal product is 1, and high-productivity workers (Group II), whose \n",
      "average and marginal product is 2. Workers will be employed by competitive \n",
      "firms whose products sell for $10,000, and who expect an average of 10 years' \n",
      "work from each employee. We also assume that half the workers in the popula­\n",
      "tion are in Group I and the other half in Group II, so that the average productiv­\n",
      "ity of all workers is 1.5. Note that the revenue expected to be generated from \n",
      "Group I workers is $100,000 ($10,000/year X lOyears) and from Group II \n",
      "workers is $200,000 ($20,000 /year X 10 years). \n",
      "If firms could identify people by their productivity, they would offer them a \n",
      "wage equal to their marginal revenue product. Group I people would be paid \n",
      "$10,000 per year, Group II people $20,000. On the other hand, if firms could not \n",
      "identify productivity before they hired people, they would pay all workers an \n",
      "annual wage equal to the average productivity-$15,000. Group I people would \n",
      "then earn more ($15,000 instead of $10,000), at the expense of Group II people \n",
      "(who would earn $15,000 instead of $20,000). \n",
      "Now let's consider what can happen with signaling via education. Suppose \n",
      "all the attributes of an education (degrees earned, grade-point average, etc.) can \n",
      "be summarized by a single index y that represents years of higher education. \n",
      "All education involves a cost, and the higher the educational level y, the higher \n",
      "the cost. This cost includes tuition and books, the opportunity cost of foregone \n",
      "wages, and the psychic cost of having to work hard to obtain high grades. What \n",
      "is important is that the cost of education is greater for the low-productivity group \n",
      "than for the high-productivity group. We might expect this to be the case for two \n",
      "reasons. First, low-productivity workers may simply be less studious. Second, \n",
      "low-productivity workers may progress more slowly through degree programs. \n",
      "In particular, suppose that for Group I people, the cost of attaining educational \n",
      "level y is given by \n",
      "Cr(Y) = $40,000y \n",
      "and the cost for Group II people is \n",
      "Cn(Y) = $20,000y \n",
      "Now suppose (to keep things simple and to dramatize the importance of sig­\n",

      "a signal. Let's see if we can find a market equilibrium in which different people \n",
      "obtain different levels of education, and in which firms look at education as a \n",
      "signal of productivity. \n",
      "EQUILIBRIUM Consider the following possible equilibrium. Suppose firms \n",

      "To answer this question, we must determine how much education the \n",
      "people in each group will obtain, given that firms are using this decision rule. To \n",

      "about its production capacity than central management has. In order to avoid \n",

      "One way is to give plant managers bonuses based on either the total output \n",
      "of their plant or its operating profit. Although this approach would encourage \n",
      "managers to maximize output, it would penalize managers whose plants have \n",

      "A second way is to ask managers about their costs and capacities and then \n",

      "manager might be asked how much his or her plant can produce each year. \n",
      "Then at the end of the year, the manager receives a bonus based on how close \n",
      "the plant's output was to this target. For example, if the manager's estimate of \n",

      "Under this scheme, however, managers would have an incentive to underesti­\n",

      "Now we can see why a fee ($3) might be preferable to a standard (7 units). \n",
      "Faced with a $3 fee, Firm 1 will reduce emissions by 6 units and Firm 2 by \n",
      "8 units-the efficient outcome. By contrast, under an emissions standard, Firm \n",

      "In general, fees can be preferable to standards for several reasons. First, when \n",
      "standards must be applied equally to all firms, fees achieve the same emissions \n",

      "standard is preferable when the marginal external cost curve is steep and \n",

      "THE CASE FOR STANDARDS Now let's examine the case for standards by \n",
      "looking at Figure 18.7. While the marginal external cost curve is very steep, the \n",
      "marginal cost of abatement is relatively flat. The efficient emissions fee is $8. \n",
      "But suppose that because of limited information, a lower fee of $7 is charged \n",
      "(this fee amounts to a 1/8 or 12.5 percent reduction). Because the MCA curve is \n",
      "flat, the firm's emissions will be increased from 8 to 11 units. This increase low­\n",
      "ers the firm's abatement costs somewhat, but because the MEC curve is steep, \n",
      "there will be substantial additional social costs. The increase in social costs, less \n",
      "the savings in abatement costs, is given by the entire shaded (light and dark) \n",
      "triangle ABC. \n",
      "What happens if a comparable error is made in setting the standard? The ef­\n",
      "ficient standard is 8 units of emissions. But suppose the standard is relaxed by \n",
      "12.5 percent, from 8 to 9 units. As before, this change will lead to an increase \n",
      "in social costs and a decrease in abatement costs. But the net increase in social \n",
      "costs, given by the small triangle ADE, is much smaller than before. \n",
      "This example illustrates the difference between standards and fees. When \n",
      "the marginal external cost curve is relatively steep and the marginal cost of \n",

      "such cases, a standard is preferable to a fee. With incomplete information, \n",
      "standards offer more certainty about emissions levels but leave the costs \n",

      "We can reach the goal of reducing emissions efficiently by using tradeable \n",

      "Under the permit system, the firms least able to reduce emissions are those \n",
      "that purchase permits. Thus, suppose the two firms in Figure 18.6 (page 662) \n",

      "therefore sell its permit to Firm 1 for a price between $2.50 and $3.75. \n",
      "If there are enough firms and permits, a competitive market for permits will \n",

      "Marketable emissions permits create a market for externalities. This market \n",
      "approach is appealing because it combines some of the advantageous features \n",

      "good and the price at which she is willing to sell the same good to someone else. \n",
      "Our basic theory of consumer behavior says that this price should be the same, \n",
      "but many experiments suggest that is not what happens in practice.4 \n",
      "In one classroom experiment, half of the students chosen at random were \n",
      "given a free coffee mug with a market value of $5; the other half got nothing.5 \n",

      "they would accept in lieu of a mug. The decision faced by both groups is simi­\n",
      "lar but their reference points are different. For the first group, whose reference \n",
      "point was possession of a mug, the average selling price was $7. For the second \n",
      "group, which did not have a mug, the average amount desired in lieu of a mug \n",
      "was $3.50. This gap in prices shows that giving up the mug was perceived to be \n",
      "a greater \"loss\" to those who had one than the \"gain\" from obtaining a mug for \n",
      "those without one. This is an endowment effect-the mug was worth more to \n",
      "those people who already owned it. \n",
      "LOSS AVERSION The coffee mug experiment described above is also an ex­\n",
      "ample of loss aversion-the tendency of individuals to prefer avoiding losses \n",

      "the charity asks you to choose: $20, $50, $100, $250, or \"other.\" The purpose of \n",
      "these suggestions is to induce you to anchor your final donation. Anchoring \n",

      "When economists design public policies, they often assume that the consumers \n",

      "informed. An example is the use of a tax to reduce or eliminate a negative external­\n",
      "ity, such as pollution. Go back to Figure 18.1 in the previous chapter. Part (b) of that \n",
      "figure describes an industry where the firms emit a pollutant roughly proportion­\n",
      "ally to their output. As a result there is a marginal external cost (MEC), which in \n",
      "the figure rises linearly with industry output. Thus the marginal social cost (MSC) \n",
      "of industry output is greater than the marginal private cost (MC), which defines \n",
      "the industry supply curve. If unregulated, industry output, Q1, is greater than the \n",
      "socially optimal output, Q*. As explained in Chapter 18, the public policy solution \n",
      "might be a tax on output that makes the marginal private cost equal to the mar­\n",
      "ginal social cost, so that output is reduced to the socially optimal level Q*. \n",
      "But perhaps there is another way to think about-and respond to-this pol­\n",
      "lution problem. Suppose the pollutant at issue is carbon dioxide, CO2, which \n",
      "creates an external cost because it contributes to global warming and climate \n",
      "change. (Recall our analysis of global warming in Example 18.4.) The typical \n",
      "response suggested by policy analysts is a carbon tax, which would raise the mar­\n",
      "ginal private cost of burning fossil fuels and thereby reduce CO2 emissions. This \n",
      "assumes, however, that firms and consumers are fully informed about their own \n",
      "private costs of burning fossil fuels. But this assumption might be incorrect. \n",
      "It might well be that if they were properly informed, consumers and firms, on \n",
      "their own and without the incentives of a tax, would reduce their use of fossil \n",
      "fuels. Why might this be the case? Consider the option of replacing incandescent \n",
      "light bulbs with LED bulbs, which are far more energy efficient. (A 12-watt LED \n",
      "bulb, for example, will produce the same amount of light as a 100-watt incan­\n",
      "descent bulb.) While LED bulbs are more expensive than incandescent bulbs, \n",
      "the savings in electricity usage are so large that the LED bulbs will usually pay \n",
      "for themselves in a year or two and thus save money. So, with almost no effort \n",
      "and little or no cost, consumers (and firms) can reduce energy consumption (and \n",
      "thus reduce CO2 emissions by electric power plants). They just need to be prop­\n",
      "erly informed in order to be incentivized to change their light bulbs. Likewise, \n",
      "energy consumption can be reduced if consumers are better informed about the \n",
      "cost savings of better insulation, \"smart\" thermostats, and so on. \n",
      "This is where behavioral economics comes into play in the design of public \n",
      "policy. If the policy objective is to reduce energy use, we need to understand \n",
      "how people's behavior affects the decisions they make regarding energy. If con­\n",
      "sumers were fully rational and utility-maximizing, they would make the effort \n",
      "on their own to learn about the cost savings from LED light bulbs and then act \n",
      "accordingly by switching to LED bulbs. But that's asking too much of consum­\n",

      "The report in Chapter 4.1 - Individual Demand discusses the concept of individual demand and its determinants. Individual demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that an individual is willing and able to purchase at a given price and time. The determinants of individual demand include the price of the good or service, the individual's income, the prices of related goods, and the individual's preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The law of demand states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. This relationship is represented by the demand curve, which is a graphical representation of the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded. The demand curve slopes downward from left to right, indicating the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The income effect and the substitution effect are two important concepts that explain the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded. The income effect refers to the change in the quantity demanded of a good or service due to a change in the individual's income. If the price of a good or service remains constant, an increase in income will lead to an increase in the quantity demanded, and vice versa. The substitution effect refers to the change in the quantity demanded of a good or service due to a change in the price of a related good or service. If the price of a substitute good or service increases, the quantity demanded of the original good or service will increase, and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of elasticity is also important in understanding individual demand. Elasticity refers to the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price or income. The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. If the price elasticity of demand is greater than one, the good or service is considered elastic, meaning that a small change in price will lead to a large change in quantity demanded. If the price elasticity of demand is less than one, the good or service is considered inelastic, meaning that a change in price will have a relatively small effect on quantity demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded of one good or service divided by the percentage change in the price of a related good or service. If the cross-price elasticity of demand is positive, the two goods or services are substitutes, meaning that an increase in the price of one will lead to an increase in the quantity demanded of the other. If the cross-price elasticity of demand is negative, the two goods or services are complements, meaning that an increase in the price of one will lead to a decrease in the quantity demanded of the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the concept of consumer surplus is important in understanding individual demand. Consumer surplus refers to the difference between the maximum price that an individual is willing to pay for a good or service and the actual price that they pay. Consumer surplus represents the benefit that the individual receives from purchasing the good or service, and can be calculated as the area below the demand curve and above the actual price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the concept of individual demand is important in understanding how individuals make consumption decisions and how these decisions are influenced by various factors such as price, income, and preferences. The determinants of individual demand, the law of demand, the income and substitution effects, elasticity, cross-price elasticity, and consumer surplus are all key concepts that are essential in understanding individual demand.\n"

      "The concept of consumer surplus is an important one in microeconomics. It refers to the difference between the maximum amount that a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and the actual price that they pay. In other words, it is the benefit that a consumer receives from purchasing a good or service at a price that is lower than what they would have been willing to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer surplus can be illustrated graphically using a demand curve. The demand curve shows the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity that consumers are willing to purchase at that price. The area below the demand curve and above the price represents the total amount that consumers are willing to pay for the good or service. The area below the price and above the quantity purchased represents the total amount that consumers actually pay for the good or service. The difference between these two areas is the consumer surplus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mathematically, consumer surplus can be calculated as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "CS = WTP - P\n",
      "\n",
      "Where CS is the consumer surplus, WTP is the consumer's willingness to pay, and P is the actual price paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer surplus is important because it represents a measure of the overall welfare that consumers receive from a market. When consumer surplus is high, it indicates that consumers are able to purchase goods and services at prices that are lower than what they would have been willing to pay. This can lead to increased consumer satisfaction and overall economic efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several factors that can affect consumer surplus. One of the most important is the elasticity of demand. When demand is elastic, small changes in price can lead to large changes in the quantity demanded. This means that consumers are more sensitive to changes in price, and are more likely to experience high levels of consumer surplus. On the other hand, when demand is inelastic, changes in price have little effect on the quantity demanded. This means that consumers are less sensitive to changes in price, and are less likely to experience high levels of consumer surplus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor that can affect consumer surplus is the availability of substitutes. When there are many substitutes available for a good or service, consumers are more likely to be able to find a lower price. This can lead to higher levels of consumer surplus. Conversely, when there are few substitutes available, consumers may be forced to pay higher prices, leading to lower levels of consumer surplus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, consumer surplus is an important concept in microeconomics that helps to measure the welfare that consumers receive from a market. It can be calculated using a demand curve and represents the difference between the maximum amount that a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price that they pay. Factors that can affect consumer surplus include the elasticity of demand and the availability of substitutes.\n"

Production refers to the process of transforming inputs into outputs, which can be goods or services. The report highlights the importance of understanding the production process as it is a crucial aspect of the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report introduces the concept of production function, which is a mathematical representation of the relationship between inputs and outputs. The production function can be expressed as Q = f(K, L), where Q is the quantity of output, K is the quantity of capital, and L is the quantity of labor. The production function shows how the quantity of output depends on the quantity of inputs used in the production process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report also discusses the concept of marginal product, which is the additional output produced by using one more unit of input. The marginal product of labor (MPL) is the additional output produced by using one more unit of labor, while the marginal product of capital (MPK) is the additional output produced by using one more unit of capital. The report highlights that the marginal product of labor and capital are important in determining the optimal combination of inputs to use in the production process.\n",

      "The report discusses various concepts related to production in microeconomics. The top 10 concepts are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Production Function: A production function is a mathematical representation of the relationship between inputs and outputs in the production process. It shows how much output can be produced from a given set of inputs. The production function can be represented as Q = f(K, L), where Q is the output, K is the capital input, and L is the labor input.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Marginal Product: The marginal product is the additional output that can be produced by using one more unit of input while holding other inputs constant. It is calculated as the change in output divided by the change in input.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns: The law of diminishing marginal returns states that as more and more units of a variable input are added to a fixed input, the marginal product of the variable input will eventually decrease.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Isoquants: Isoquants are curves that represent all the combinations of inputs that can produce a given level of output. They are similar to indifference curves in consumer theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution: The marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) is the rate at which one input can be substituted for another while holding output constant. It is calculated as the ratio of the marginal product of one input to the marginal product of the other input.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Returns to Scale: Returns to scale refer to the relationship between the scale of production and the output. If the output increases proportionally more than the inputs when the scale of production is increased, it is called increasing returns to scale. If the output increases proportionally less than the inputs, it is called decreasing returns to scale. If the output increases proportionally to the inputs, it is called constant returns to scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Long-Run Average Cost Curve: The long-run average cost (LRAC) curve shows the lowest average cost at which a firm can produce a given level of output in the long run. It is derived from the short-run average cost curves.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Economies of Scale: Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that a firm can achieve by increasing the scale of production. It can be due to technical, managerial, or financial factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Diseconomies of Scale: Diseconomies of scale refer to the cost disadvantages that a firm can experience by increasing the scale of production. It can be due to coordination problems, communication problems, or bureaucratic inefficiencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Minimum Efficient Scale: The minimum efficient scale (MES) is the smallest level of output at which a firm can produce at the lowest LRAC. It is the point where the LRAC curve reaches its minimum. The MES can vary depending on the industry and the technology used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these concepts are important for understanding the production process and the cost structure of firms. They can help firms make decisions about the optimal level of production and the most efficient use of resources.\n"
